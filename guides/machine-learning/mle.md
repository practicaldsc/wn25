## Overview

There is a close relationship between the fields of probability and statistics:
- In probability questions, we're given some model of how the universe works, and it's our job to determine how various samples could turn out.<br><small>Example: If we have 5 blue marbles and 3 green marbles and pick 2 at random with replacement, what are the chances we see one marble of each color?</small>
- In statistics questions, we're given information about a sample, and it's our job to figure out how the universe ‚Äì or data generating process ‚Äì works. Broadly speaking, this is what machine learning is about, too.<br><small>Example: Repeatedly, I picked 2 marbles at random from a bag with replacement. I don't know what's inside the bag. One time, I saw 2 blue marbles, then next time I saw 1 of each, the next time I saw 2 red marbles, and so on. What marbles are inside the bag?</small>

## Problem Setup

Suppose we find a coin on the ground, and we're unsure of whether the coin is **fair**. We decide to flip the coin repeatedly to estimate its **bias**, $$\theta$$, which is the probability of flipping heads on any particular flip. (The probability of flipping tails on any particular flip, then, is $$1 - \theta$$).

Suppose we flip the coin 100 times and see 65 heads. Assuming that each flip is independent, this is a _possible_ result, no matter what the value of $$\theta$$ is, as long as $$0 < \theta < 1$$. But, some values of $$\theta$$ are more believable than others:

- For example, if $$\theta = 0.5$$, the probability of seeing 65 heads and 35 tails is:

$$\mathbb{P}(65 \text{ heads} \: | \: \theta = 0.5) = {\binom{100}{65}} 0.5^{65} 0.5^{35} \approx 0.00086$$

- If $$\theta = 0.7$$, the probability of seeing 65 heads and 35 tails is:

$$\mathbb{P}(65 \text{ heads} \: | \: \theta = 0.7) = {\binom{100}{65}} 0.7^{65} 0.3^{35} \approx 0.04678$$

The true bias, $$\theta$$, could be anything, and we don't actually know what it is since we just found this coin on the ground. But, as we see above, some values of $$\theta$$ **better explain** our observed data than others. For instance, it seems that $$\theta = 0.7$$ makes our observation **more likely** than $$\theta = 0.5$$ makes our observation, because the probability of our observation is higher if we assume $$\theta = 0.7$$ than if we assume $$\theta = 0.5$$.

$$\theta = 0.5$$ and $$\theta = 0.7$$ were arbitrarily chosen values of $$\theta$$, just for illustration. The question is, **among all possible $$\theta$$'s, which value of $$\theta$$ maximizes the probability of the observed data**?

## The Likelihood Function

To answer this question, we'll define what's known as the **likelihood** function of $$\theta$$, denoted $$L(\theta)$$:

$$L(\theta) = \mathbb{P}(65 \text{ heads} \: | \: \theta) = {\binom{100}{65}} \theta^{65} (1-\theta)^{35}$$

We're using the word likelihood and symbol $$L$$ to make clear that this function is _not_ a probability distribution. The sum of $$L(\theta)$$ for all possible $$\theta$$'s isn't 1. Instead, this function is designed to help us decide which value of $$\theta$$ makes our observed data most likely.

We've used the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of seeing 65 heads and 35 tails, given a bias of $$\theta$$.  Remember, we don't truly know what the value of $$\theta$$ is, but our job is to find the $$\theta$$ that best explains our observation, i.e. the one that makes the data most likely, or gives our observed data the highest probability.

$$\theta$$ is referred to as a **parameter** of the binomial distribution, and our goal is to **estimate** $$\theta$$ as best as we can, given our data. As we'll learn in the machine learning section of the course, a parameter defines the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a model. As we typically do in machine learning, we're using the data we're given to find the best, or optimal, parameters. Here, the model is a binomial one, which takes in a number of heads and outputs the probability of seeing that many heads.

Let's look at a plot of $$L(\theta)$$ for various values of $$\theta$$.

</center>

You should notice that $$L(\theta)$$ peaks at 0.65, which is the empirical proportion of heads ‚Äì remember that we saw 65 heads in 100 flips of this coin! This is saying that, of all possible $$\theta$$'s, the $$\theta$$ that produces the largest probability of seeing 65 heads and 35 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin is $$\theta = 0.65$$.

Remember, the likelihood function, $$L(\theta)$$, **does not** represent a probability distribution! The area underneath the curve above does not add up to 1.

## Maximizing Likelihood

Let's see if we can prove that this is always the case. That is, let's prove that the $$\theta$$ that makes the observed data most likely, when we flip a coin many times, is $$\frac{\text{number of heads}}{\text{total number of flips}}$$.

First, let's pose the problem more generally. If we have a coin that flips heads with probability $$\theta$$, the probability of seeing $$k$$ heads in $$n$$ independent flips of the coin is:

$$L(\theta) = \mathbb{P}(k \text{ heads} \: | \: \theta) = {n \choose k} \theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k}$$

The question at hand is, which value of $$\theta$$ **maximizes** $$L(\theta)$$, i.e. which $$\theta$$ makes the data most likely?

$$L(\theta)$$ is a function of a single variable. To find the value of $$\theta$$ that maximizes it, we'll follow a process that should be familiar from Calculus 1. We can take the derivative of $$L(\theta)$$ with respect to $$\theta$$, and solve for the value of $$\theta$$ that makes the derivative 0. To find the derivative of $$L(\theta)$$ with respect to $$\theta$$, we'll need to use the power, product, and chain rules from calculus. Here we go!

$$\begin{align*} L(\theta) &= { n \choose k } \theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k} \\ \frac{d}{d\theta}L(\theta) &= { n \choose k } \big( k\theta^{k-1} (1-\theta)^{n-k} + \theta^k (n-k)(1-\theta)^{n-k-1}(-1) \big) \end{align*}$$

Now, we'll set this to 0 and solve for the $$\theta$$ that makes this happen. We're going to call the resulting value $$\theta^*$$, to emphasize that it's the "best" $$\theta$$ in some sense.

$$\begin{align*} { n \choose k }\cdot \left( k\theta^{k-1} (1-\theta)^{n-k} + \theta^k (n-k)(1-\theta)^{n-k-1}(-1) \right) &= 0 \\ k\theta^{k-1} (1-\theta)^{n-k} - \theta^k (n-k)(1-\theta)^{n-k-1} &= 0 \\ k\theta^{k-1} (1-\theta)^{n-k} &= \theta^k (n-k)(1-\theta)^{n-k-1} \\ k (1-\theta) &= \theta (n-k) \\ k - \theta k &= \theta n - \theta k \\ k &= \theta n \\ \theta^* &= \boxed{\frac{k}{n}} \end{align*}$$

Since $$\theta^* = \frac{k}{n}$$ is the input to $$L(\theta)$$ that **maximizes** the likelihood function, $$L(\theta)$$, we call $$\theta^*$$ the **maximum likelihood estimate** of $$\theta$$. Sometimes we'll denote this as $$\theta^*_\text{MLE}$$, since there are other ways of estimating the bias of the coin, and this is just the best estimate using the maximum likelihood estimation technique.

In our example, $$k = 65$$ and $$n = 100$$, which means the maximum likelihood estimate of the bias of the coin we found on the ground is $$\frac{65}{100} = 0.65$$! This matches what we saw in the graph earlier, and also shouldn't be surprising. In our 100 flips of this random coin off the ground, we saw 65 heads and 35 tails, and so while the bias of the coin could be anything, the bias that makes the data most likely is $$\theta^* = 0.65$$.

We've now walked through a full example of the method of maximum likelihood estimation.

## Maximizing Log Likelihood

The process of solving for $$\theta^*$$ was messy, because taking the derivative of $$L(p)$$ was messy, since it involved using the power, product, and chain rules!

It turns out that there's a simplification we can use here to make our lives easier, that is often used in machine learning and statistics.

> **Fact**: If $$x^*$$ maximizes $$f(x)$$, then $$x^*$$ also maximizes $$\log f(x)$$.<br>Related, if $$x^*$$ minimizes $$f(x)$$, then $$x^*$$ also minimizes $$\log f(x)$$.

To see why this is true, let's plot a graph of $$\log L(\theta)$$ vs. $$\theta$$:

<center>

<iframe src="../assets/mle-2.html" width="650" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

</center>

While the graph of $$\log L(\theta)$$ looks very different than the graph of $$L(\theta)$$, they are both maximized at the same position, $$\theta^* = 0.65$$. The reason for this is that $$\log$$ is **monotonically increasing**, meaning that if $$a > b$$, then $$\log(a) > \log(b)$$. The consequence of this is that if $$L(0.65)$$ is bigger than $$L(\theta)$$ for any other $$\theta$$, then $$\log L(0.65)$$ is bigger than $$\log L(\theta)$$ for any other $$\theta$$, too.

You may be wondering, and rightfully so:

> Why did you randomly bring out the $$\log$$ function ‚Äì isn't this explanation already long and mathematical enough?

It turns out that maximizing $$\log L(\theta)$$ is **way** easier than maximizing $$L(\theta)$$! Here, let's work through it. First, let's simplify $$\log L(\theta)$$. Note that we could use any base on our logarithm, but the calculations are simplest if we use the natural logarithm (which we'll just denote with $$\log$$).

$$\begin{align*} L(\theta) &= {n \choose k} \theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k} \\ \log L(\theta) &= \log \left( {n \choose k} \theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k} \right) \\ &= \log {n \choose k}  + \log \left(\theta^k \right) + \log \left((1 - \theta)^{n-k}\right) \\ &= \log {n \choose k} + k \log \theta + (n - k) \log (1 - \theta) \end{align*}$$

Now, let's take the derivative of $$\log L(\theta)$$ and set it to 0:

$$\begin{align*} \log L(\theta) &= \log {n \choose k} + k \log \theta + (n - k) \log (1 - \theta) \\ \frac{d}{d\theta} \log L(\theta) &= 0 + k \cdot \frac{1}{\theta} + (n - k) \cdot\frac{1}{1 - \theta}(-1) = \frac{k}{\theta} - \frac{n - k}{1 - \theta} \\ 0 &= \frac{k}{\theta} - \frac{n - k}{1 - \theta}  \\ \frac{k}{\theta} &= \frac{n - k}{1 - \theta} \\ k - \theta k &= \theta n - \theta k \\ k &= \theta n \\ \theta^* &= \boxed{\frac{k}{n}}  \end{align*}$$

By taking the log of $$L(\theta)$$, we were able to find the maximum likelihood estimate, $$\theta^*$$, without needing to find the derivative of $$L(\theta)$$, which involved working with expressions like $$ k\theta^{k-1} (1-\theta)^{n-k} + \theta^k (n-k)(1-\theta)^{n-k-1}(-1)$$.

The benefit of the log function is that it turns **products** into **sums** ‚Äì that is, $$\log(a \cdot b) = \log(a) + \log(b)$$ ‚Äì which allows us to bypass using the messy product rule.

## Summary

1. We found a coin on the ground, which flips heads with an unknown probability, $$\theta$$.
1. We flipped the coin 100 times and saw 65 heads.
1. To estimate the bias of the coin, we decided to use **maximum likelihood estimation**, which requires us to define the **likelihood function** for $$\theta$$:

    $$L(\theta) = \mathbb{P}(k \text{ heads} \: | \: \theta) = {n \choose k} \theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k}$$

    In the example stated above, $$k = 65$$ and $$n = 100$$.

4. The **maximum likelihood estimate** of $$\theta$$ is the value of $$\theta$$ **maximizes** $$L(\theta)$$. This is the value of $$\theta$$ that maximizes the probability of the observed data.
5. To make the math simpler, instead of maximizing $$L(\theta)$$ directly, we maximized $$\log L(\theta)$$. This found us the same maximum likelihood estimate, $$\theta^* = \frac{k}{n}$$.
