Guides are explanations of selected topics from lectures and homeworks, written specifically for EECS 398. Whenever a guide is referenced in class, you are expected to read it thoroughly.

Guides are a work-in-progress this semester. More will be added as the semester progresses; let us know if you spot any errors or have any suggestions.
