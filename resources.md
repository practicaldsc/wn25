## Past Exams

Past exams can be found at [🧠 Study Site](https://study.practicaldsc.org/), the same site discussion worksheets will be posted at.

If you'd like some additional practice from similar classes Suraj taught at UC San Diego, you can refer to:
- [practice.dsc80.com](https://practice.dsc80.com) – most similar to our course.
- [practice.dsc40a.com](https://practice.dsc40a.com) – more theoretical than our course, but some problems will be relevant.
- [practice.dsc10.com](https://practice.dsc10.com) – more introductory-level than our course, but some DataFrame-related problems will be relevant.

## Guides

This semester, we're developing several supplementary guides that directly relate to lecture material. Find them [**here**](https://practicaldsc.org/guides/).

---

## Readings

- [Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/), the textbook for Berkeley's [Data 100](https://ds100.org) course.
    - These are also supplemented by a set of [Course Notes](https://ds100.org/course-notes/).
- [DSC 80 Course Notes](https://notes.dsc80.com). These notes were originally written for UCSD's version of this course, but have not been updated in a few years.
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), an online textbook by Wes Mickinney, the original developer of `pandas`. 
- [DSC 10 Course Notes](https://notes.dsc10.com). These notes were written for UCSD's more introductory data science course, which introduces Python and Jupyter Notebooks. You'll find a lot of the material here useful, too.
- [Stanford's Python Reference](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/py/).
- [EECS 201: Computer Science Pragmatics](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs201/fa2024/schedule). This class covers "the essentials of using a computer effectively for EECS students," and covers Unix-like systems, shells, version control, build systems, debugging, and scripting.
