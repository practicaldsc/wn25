    "Welcome to Homework 1! In this homework, you will practice with core features of the Python language, including defining functions, writing conditional statements and loops, and working with lists and strings. You'll also gain experience in reading documentation to figure out how to work with unfamiliar libraries. Finally, you'll practice writing proofs that involve summations, which will be crucial in the coming weeks as we aim to understand the math behind machine learning.\n",
