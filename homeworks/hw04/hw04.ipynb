    "Welcome to Homework 4! In this homework, you will practice exploratory data analysis. That is, you'll learn how to take messy data, clean it for analysis, draw meaningful visualizations from it, and impute missing values. You'll also practice with scraping messy data from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given 8 slip days throughout the semester to extend deadlines. See the [Syllabus](https://practicaldsc.org/syllabus) for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access this notebook, you'll need to clone our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicaldsc/wn25/). The [Environment Setup](https://practicaldsc.org/env-setup) page on the course website walks you through the necessary steps. Once you're done, you'll submit your completed notebook to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start early and submit often. You can submit as many times as you'd like to Gradescope, and we'll grade your **most recent** submission. Remember that the public `grader.check` tests in your notebook are not comprehensive, and that your work will also be graded on hidden test cases on Gradescope after the submission deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is worth a total of **46 points**, 37 of which come from the autograder, **and 9 of which are manually graded by us** (Questions 4.1 and 4.2). The number of points each question is worth is listed at the start of each question. **Most questions in the assignment are independent, so feel free to move around if you get stuck**.

    "\n",
    "In Question 4, you are asked to create visualizations that we will manually grade; we will look at your visualizations directly in your notebook after you submit it. To ensure that we can properly grade your notebook, make sure that your visualizations are visible on Gradescope after you submit.\n",

    "This is a _little_ better. Still, another idea is to place credit scores into categories by **binning** them. According to [Experian](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/score-basics/what-is-a-good-credit-score/#s1), one of the three major credit bureaus in the US, FICO credit scores are described qualitatively as follows:\n",

    "|---|---|\n",
    "| 580 - 669 | Fair |\n",

    "| 740 - 799 | Very Good |\n",

    "Once we place credit scores into bins, we can visualize the distribution of interest rates separately for each credit score bin. Here, that would allow us to draw four separate distributions of interest rates – one for the fair group, one for the good group, one for the very good group, and one for the excellent group. Each one of those four distributions are **numerical distributions**, which we have several tools for visualizing, including histograms, box plots, and violin plots."

    "In [Lecture 7](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/lectures/lec07/lec07-filled.html#Idea:-Probabilistic-imputation), you learned how to impute a quantitative column by sampling from the observed values. **One problem with this technique is that the imputation will never generate imputed values that weren't already in the dataset.** For example, 57, 57.5, and 59 are values in the `'child'` column of `new_heights` while 58 is not. Thus, any imputation done by sampling from the observed values in the `'child'` column will not be able to generate a height of 58, even though it's clearly a reasonable value to occur in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you will impute the `'child'` column **unconditionally** from the distribution of `'child'` heights present in the dataset. This means that you will use the values present in `'child'` to impute missing values, without looking at other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to quantitative imputation that overcomes the limitation mentioned above is as follows:\n",
    "- Create a histogram of observed `'child'` heights, using 10 bins.\n",
    "- Use the histogram to generate a new `'child'` height to impute with, somewhere within the observed range of `'child'` heights:\n",
    "    - The probability a generated `'child'` height will come from a given bin is equal to the proportion of `'observed'` values in that bin. For example, if 20\\% of observed `'child'` heights fall within a particular bin, then there's a 20\\% chance we select that bin to draw a new `'child'` height from.\n",
    "    - Once we select a bin, any value within that bin's left and right endpoints is equally likely to be drawn. For example, if we selected the bin [12, 14), we could choose any real number between 12 (inclusive) and 14 (exclusive) to fill in as our missing `'child'` height; `np.random.uniform` can help us pick that number between 12 and 14.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's illustrate this approach with an example. Let `demo` be the array of 10 numbers defined below.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src='imgs/histogram-demo.png' width=700></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that in your implementation, you don't actually need to draw a histogram – instead, use `np.histogram`. (Play around with it to figure out how it works.)\n",
    "- In the histogram above, we see that $\\frac{3}{10}$ of values lie in the [10, 12) bin, $\\frac{2}{10}$ of values lie in the [12, 14) bin, $\\frac{4}{10}$ of values lie in the [14, 16) bin, and $\\frac{1}{10}$ of values lie in the [16, 18] bin.\n",
    "- Next, we need to pick a bin at random. There's a 30\\% chance we pick the [10, 12) bin, a 20\\% chance we pick the [12, 14) bin, a 40\\% chance we pick the [14, 16) bin, and a 10\\% chance we pick the [16, 18] bin. `np.random.choice` will be helpful in picking a bin at random.\n",
    "- Once we pick a bin, we pick a number **uniformly at random** from within the bin. For instance, suppose we randomly chose the [14, 16) bin in the previous step. We then must select a (real) number between 14 and 16 uniformly at random; as mentioned above, `np.random.uniform` can help us here.\n",
