    "To access this notebook, you'll need to clone our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicaldsc/wn25/). The [Environment Setup](https://practicaldsc.org/env-setup) page on the course website walks you through the necessary steps. Once you're done, you'll submit your completed notebook to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start early and submit often. You can submit as many times as you'd like to Gradescope, and we'll grade your **most recent** submission. Remember that the public `grader.check` tests in your notebook are not comprehensive, and that your work will also be graded on hidden test cases on Gradescope after the submission deadline.\n",

    "This homework is worth a total of **58 points**, 49 of which come from the autograder, **and 9 of which are manually graded by us** (Questions 1.3, 6.1, and 6.2). The number of points each question is worth is listed at the start of each question. **Each question in the assignment is independent, so feel free to move around if you get stuck**.

    "If you answered Question 2.3 correctly, you'll see above that in 2016, the Democratic `'party'` won the most votes of any `'party'`, with 48.5\\% of the total vote. But, the Democratic `'party'` **did not** actually win the 2016 presidential election ‚Äì the Republican `'party'` did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is the Electoral College, which is explained in sufficient detail in the [article that was linked before](https://kz.usembassy.gov/summary-of-the-u-s-presidential-election-process/). In short, there are 538 Electoral College votes total, and each `'state'` (plus Washington D.C., which is treated like a `'state'` for the purposes of the Electoral College) is assigned some number of Electoral College votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'candidate'` that wins the most votes in a particular `'state'` wins **all** of the Electoral College votes assigned to that `'state'`*. For example, in 2024, the Republican `'party'` only won 49.7% of the vote in Michigan, but because this was more than any other `'party'` won in Michigan, the Republican `'party'` took all 15 Electoral College votes assigned to Michigan.\n",

    "So, in the 2016 election, even though the Democratic `'party'` won more votes overall ‚Äì i.e. they won the \"popular vote\" ‚Äì they won fewer Electoral College votes, and so they lost the election to the Republicans. To win the election, a `'party'` needs to win at least 270 of the 538 Electoral College votes. (Why 270? $\\frac{538}{2} = 269$, so if both `'party'`s won 269 votes, there would be a tie.)\n",
    "\n",
    "_*Caveat: This is not exactly how the Electoral College works in Nebraska and New Hampshire, but for simplicity, we will assume that these two `'state'`s work the same way as all other `'state'`s, in that they give all of their Electoral College votes to the `'candidate'` that won the most votes in their `'state'`._\n",

The colors you choose do not matter, except for the fact that **you cannot use the default colors that `px.choropleth` uses**. (If you want to use the politically accurate colors, as we did above, the Republicans use red and the Democrats use blue.) You'll need to either read the documentation or do some Googling to figure out how to change colors for different categories, but as a hint, these can be set using an argument to `px.choropleth` (i.e. you don't need to use `fig.update_layout`).<br><br>\n",
