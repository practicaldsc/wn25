AAS 290 - Selected Topics in Black World Studies
Global Blackness could be used to address the complex forces shaping the idea of ‘becoming global’ and in so doing critically deepen the perspectives of Black diaspora. This course will concentrate on the lived experience of Black people in Europe. In reading Blackness in Europe, we will start with these words “Black Lives Matter.” Since its inception in the 2012 murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, Black Live Matter encapsulates the struggles of vulnerable Black people. Black Lives Matter can continually expand its reach and respond to injustices around the globe. The murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor — shot to death by police officers in her Louisville, Kentucky home — sparked the largest protests in U.S. history. Fifteen to twenty-six million people spanning racial, generational, and socioeconomic lines took to the streets to demand justice. Millions more stood in solidarity, from around the globe. In this course, we will first define the concept “Blackness” and its ramifications around European countries such as the experience of racism, vulnerability, social injustice, etc. Second, starting from the Americas, we will expand our examination of “Blackness” to other spaces (Europe most former colonizing countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain) by reading literature, films as well as social media.

How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.

AAS 330 - Living for the City: Black Study and Urban Transformation
Focusing on the historical and contemporary experiences of African Americans in U. S. cities, this course is designed for students who wish to develop historical perspectives and analytical frameworks that will help them to understand, study, and work in urban communities. Course material will span most of the twentieth century and the first two decades of the twenty-first, leading us through an interdisciplinary investigation into the processes of community formation and social change impacting contemporary urban life. We will draw from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, analytical approaches, and reflective lenses. Accordingly, course material includes: historical studies, urban sociological theory, ethnography, case studies of grassroots redevelopment efforts, memoir, local community studies, documentary film, and contemporary social criticism. Throughout the semester we will also use music and other elements of popular culture to animate and explore our subject matter. To frame our work for the semester, we will begin by critically examining the historical and contemporary uses of the words "urban," "inner city," and "ghetto." From there we will explore the history of cities in the United States since 1940 with a focus on the growth and development of black urban communities. This will lead us into studying theoretical perspectives on community-based activism and case studies of local community organizations and movements. Through this, students will learn about, discuss, and develop their own interpretations of a range of topics and issues, both historical and contemporary. These include: urban renewal, the impact of the crack epidemic, mass incarceration and prison abolition, urban rebellions, the birth of Hip Hop, gendered and racialized urban violence, gentrification, community land trusts, and urban agriculture.

# COURSE
AAS 353 - Urban Ethnography and the Black Experience
In Yo Mama's Disfunktional, leading Black historian Robin Kelley criticizes what he calls "the heyday of ghetto ethnography" - a period between the 1960s and late 1980s when representations of urban Black culture proliferated. Kelley argues that with few exceptions, insufficiently complex representations of Black life detrimentally shaped public policy, scholarship and social movements. Ironically, the liberal (and sometimes radical) ethnographers who produced this work sought to put forth a counter-view of Black people as respectable, rational, resilient and capable, in hopes of correcting neoconservative explanations of persistent black poverty as rooted in inferior culture. Since the heyday, Kelley and others have charted new urban ethnographic approaches that attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the past, by drawing attention to: historical processes of systemic oppression, sites of creativity and political organization, the heterogeneity of Black identity, the politics of activist ethnography and the meaning of cultural forms to their participants and practitioners. This course will introduce students to the U.S. Black, Black-feminist and urban anthropological traditions, with a focus on the use of ethnographic methods to attempt to revise traditional disciplinary standards of evidence, ethics and approach. In doing so, the course aims to expand students' understanding of the foundations and scope of anthropological thought and method and to hone the ability to critically evaluate representations of Black perspectives and experiences.

Feminists and anthropologists have produced voluminous work on the body as a site of gendered and sexualized practices.  Building on this rich corpus of literature, the course uses the body as a point of entry to examine the constructions and meanings of gender, health and reproduction, and their constitution of social differentiation.  By using various cross-cultural examples, we will discuss how gender, racial, and class differences are enacted and manifested in the divisions of social spaces and in bodily conduct, function, hygiene, and sickness.  In its entirety, the course attempts to introduce students to the complexity of the local and global processes underlying the cultural production of gender identities and social differentiation.

# COURSE
AAS 384 - Caribbean Literature

# COURSE
AAS 395 - Germany and the Black Diaspora
Germany is a country not often associated with the African diaspora, but what students in this class will learn, is that people of African descent have long been a part of Central European history. From Black saint iconography in medieval churches to entertainers such as Josephine Baker or Beyoncé in Berlin, Germans have long engaged with, and responded to, Black figures in European history. In so doing, they have participated in global conversations on nationalism, colonialism, race, and gender. In this class we will examine Germany’s Black pasts in general, and Afro-German history specifically, all with an eye toward interrogating the creation and interpretations of Black collective identities. In so doing, we will analyze the pitfalls and advantages of adopting U.S. theoretical paradigms to engage with issues of Black communities beyond U.S. borders, as well as broaden our understanding of the cultural and historical diversities among Germany’s Black population.

# COURSE

ALA 324 - Facilitation in Community Settings
This course prepares students to be facilitative leaders in campus and community organizations throughout their undergraduate years at U-M and beyond. Specifically, this course will focus on self-care and community-care as necessities for effective facilitation. By connecting facilitation to traditions of social justice education and activism, we’ll illuminate methods of care that past and present facilitators employ[ed] to create group cohesion, guide groups through challenging processes, and maintain and support their own wellness, as well as that of the community. The focus of this course is developing strategies for facilitating race dialogues beyond the university community. In co-facilitation pairs and with a pre-designed 10-week curriculum you will facilitate high school students through dialogues. Then students will spend 10 weeks meeting both as a practicum class with the instructors and meeting in a local (walking distance) high school facilitating the students in dialogue. Students must have some flexibility on Tuesdays for the in person high school facilitation; tentative times are Tues 10-12 or Tues 1-3.

# COURSE
ALA 470 - Applied Liberal Arts Topics
Data visualization is increasingly used to understand the world around us; from the increasing presence of the ‘Digital Humanities’ to representations of complex social systems to diagrams meant to persuade us visual representations of data are ascendant. Visualization mediates our relationship to diverse types of data and also provides a powerful tool for exploring and explaining our own research data. This seminar will explore data visualization as a technical skill and as a cultural phenomenon. We will aim both to understand how to create visualizations and to critically understand what they do in society.

AMAS 310 - Arab American Studies and the Social Sciences
This course explores the history of Arabs in the United States from the 1880s to the present. The class covers the features of and differences between three major periods of migration (before 1924, after 1965, and more recent migration) as well as thematic topics (such as gender and sexuality, labor organizing, transnationalism, political activism, government repression, and religious life). The course asks and answers the question: how have Arab Americans have experienced race and racism across time? We identify (1) the legal policies that have shaped how Arabs have been categorized racially in the U.S., (2) the impact of racism on Arab Americans and Arab American communities, and (3) the varied experiences of racialization and racism for Arab Americans that are impacted by differences in skin color, phenotype, gender, religion, and more.

# COURSE
AMAS 378 - Muslim and Arab Literatures
Long a major component of Arab American and Arab Anglophone literature, Palestinian writing in English is increasingly evolving into a singular literary body. Engaged with questions particular to Palestine and the struggle for a Palestinian future, Palestinian writing has been spreading beyond its geographic and linguistic origins and gaining readers around the world, especially Western metropolitan audiences. Such a shift was necessary as the fate of Palestine and sometimes the survival of the Palestinian people in their homeland have been questions whose answers lay almost squarely in the power centers of the Anglophone world. Yet, while it has become a worlding literature actively bringing its concerns and artistic inventions to global spheres of influence, Palestinian literature, in English and translation, must by necessity remain rooted to its homeland even while it negotiates the tribulations of  diaspora or shatat (the Arabic world for scattering). Attempting to document nearly eight decades of anti-colonial struggle, massacres, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and anticolonial resistance, Palestinian literature has also had to struggle with issues of individual freedom as well as racism, and gender and class equality. Given these circumstances, Palestinian writing is steeped in layered critiques from anti-imperialist and postcolonial discourses, to feminist criticism, to the fine points of esthetic and poetic theory, which have made it a rich, multi-faceted, and absorbing body of literature worth examining in depth.

AMCULT 103 - First Year Seminar in American Studies
From Netflix Show like Squid Game to celebrity athletes like Jeremy Lin and Naomi Osaka, Asians and Asian Americans in popular culture have offered a microcosm of American society where we can explore how a particular identity/ideology is constructed and explained in the cultural domain. This course invites students to introduce the field of cultural studies, particularly focusing on Asian American cultural studies, further examining complex, conjunctive, and multi-faceted Asian American in U.S. popular culture. This course will offer interdisciplinary approaches in order for a better understanding of intersectional meanings of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and nationalism in the context of U.S. popular culture.

# COURSE
AMCULT 202 - Digital Culture
In this course, students will cultivate a nuanced appreciation of the ways digital media and technologies shape and are shaped by contemporary culture. Digital technologies presently inform or facilitate nearly every aspect of our lives: how we communicate, learn, study, make art, travel, work, exercise, relax, protest, eat, shop, date, and more. In this course, we’ll prioritize questions about the ways digital technologies wield power and inform social and cultural ideas about gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity.

# COURSE
AMCULT 300 - Practices of American Culture
This course explores the analytical tools American Studies scholars have developed to better understand the impact of diversity on social and political life in the United States. For example, how might American Studies methods help us ask thoughtful and nuanced questions about race and ethnicity; gender and sexuality; class and labor; criminal justice; climate change; immigration; and health disparities in the nation today? Equally important, many field scholars are asking new questions about the impact of U.S. culture and politics on the global stage. Topics include U.S. military actions in Vietnam and the Middle East, as well as the impact of American business practices on the economies of nation states around the world. Course materials include scholarly articles and book chapters, as well as film, fiction, and historical artifacts.

# COURSE
AMCULT 301 - Topics in American Culture
In this course, you will practice different forms of writing (book and film review, autobiographical reflection, comparative analysis) to understand the long history and imagination of black rebellion in America. Starting with a novel about the most famous slave revolt of all, Nat Turner’s 1831 “insurrection,” and ending with Quentin Tarantino’s 2012 film Django Unchained, we will study texts (including one by a fugitive slave) to explore the possibilities and impossibilities of violent slave resistance. Did you know white enslavers and abolitionists like John Brown imagined a slave-provoked end to slavery? For those of us on the far side of a bloody Civil War which abolished slavery, that possibility still threatens – and allures -- as black resistance. This course is intended for any student interested in the topic (i.e. no prior coursework expected) or needing Upper Level Writing credit, and will feature writing workshops and drafting/revision assignments to support your learning as writers.

# COURSE
AMCULT 310 - Topics in Ethnic Studies
How do wearable technologies change what we think we know about gender and race? What privacy might we trade when we give data to fitness technologies in the name of health? Why does facial recognition software routinely fail to accurately categorize those with darker skin tones? What might menstrual trackers do with the information we give them and how might it change our experiences while using social media? This course will explore how everyday technologies are shaping what we believe about gendered and racialized bodies and in turn how our bodies are used to reinforce assumptions about gender and race in the tech industry. Students will be challenged to think about what it means to occupy a gendered and / or racialized body in todays’ automated society.

# COURSE
AMCULT 311 - American Culture and the Humanities
“At the moment of Sputnik,” wrote the media scholar Marshall McLuhan in 1973, “nature ended and ecology was born.” But what does it mean that ecological thinking becomes possible just when the Earth is captured as an image at a distance? Typically, we tend to think of technology and ecology as opposed to one another, since technology is artificial and ecology, natural. Today, the widespread penetration of screens, sensors, wireless technologies, and AI into the fabric of our everyday lives challenges us to go beyond this artificial/natural dualism. This course will explore how the theory, history, and aesthetics of media and technology can offer multiple access points for rethinking interconnected human and nonhuman ecosystems without reducing the planet to human scale or to an artifact to manipulate and control.

# COURSE
AMCULT 323 - Intermediate Ojibwe II
Continuation of AMCULT 322. The course will serve as a further introduction to Anishinaabe language and culture.

# COURSE
AMCULT 338 - Topics in Native American History
The continent we now call the North America was, for most of its history, in the hands of innumerable Indigenous communities. They have left an indelible mark on the continent, but these communities have their own rich cultures and histories of persistence, survival, and the pursuit of recognition worthy being told on their own terms. This course explores the history of Indigenous North America from time immemorial to the colonies and into the present day. By studying these histories, students will acquire a more nuanced understanding of United States, Mexican, and Canadian history and important context for the ongoing challenges of Indigenous communities in the United States specifically and North American more broadly.

# COURSE
AMCULT 346 - Media Matter: From Print to Screen Culture
Media determine our situation. This course explores their history. How have technologies such as photography, film, radio, and the computer altered the human senses, our relationship to space and time, to each other, to institutions and governments? In what ways do new technologies shape the questions we ask about the natural world and the answers we give? How have critical approaches for thinking about media evolved over the past two hundred years, and what contributions have German-speaking thinkers in particular made to media theory? Drawing on a wide range of materials including scholarly articles, primary documents, photographs, films, literary texts, and audio recordings, we will work to develop a critical vocabulary and historical framework for analyzing the varied and widely distributed effects of technological change on both patterns of thought and physical reality, the imagination and the body, social relations, and their material networks and infrastructures. Topics include the so-called ‘reading revolution’ in late eighteenth-century Europe, print culture and the Enlightenment, human mediumship, spiritualism, and the occult, technology, and science, sound recording and the voice, radio and the Third Reich, cyborgs, and the ‘post-human,’ automation and surveillance, democracy and digital activism.

# COURSE
AMCULT 350 - Broadway and American Culture
Do you love musicals? Really LOVE musicals? Are you also kind of disappointed in them? (I’m looking at you Book of Mormon.) Do you have questions about the problematic history and racial politics of many beloved musicals? (cough, cough, West Side Story) Do you wonder whether Hamilton was a revolutionary as everyone claimed? Do you think how a show is cast, which actors play which roles, really matters? Do you want to go to musicals, listen to original Broadway cast recordings (not soundtracks!), talk about musicals, and learn about musicals? This course will explore the history of racial representation in musical theatre, how popular theatrical performance constructs race as an identifiable category, and techniques of analysis for “reading” performances to understand the cultural construction happening within and through American musical theatre. We will build a critical vocabulary and a set of analytical tools for critiquing racial representation in embodied performance and attending to the relationship between musical theatre and American culture. We will also pay attention to the material impact of artistic and production choices (i.e. casting, revisals, finances) on the politics and practices of categorization, identity, and representation. This course uses GradeCraft.

# COURSE
AMCULT 359 - South Asian Diaspora in America
In recent years, South Asian Americans have become an increasingly visible presence in American popular culture, as writers and characters on TV shows, stand-up comics, and most recently, the winners of Spelling Bees and Miss America Pageants. Such narratives have filled a convenient script for the “model minority” myth of the U.S., while troublingly glossing over reports that are far more dissonant with narratives of the American dream. Instances of racism and xenophobia against South Asian enclaves have occurred in the 1980s, while racial profiling and violence against South Asians, particularly Sikhs and Muslims, by state and non-state actors spiked after 9/11. But for more than a century, South Asians have played a key role in North American history, at the center of legal and historical cases that changed the parameters of race and citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. This course will explore this long history — from the earliest settlers who arrived in the late nineteenth century to the effects of the "War on Terror." We will also consider how writers, filmmakers, and other artists have explored the experiences of diaspora and immigration, and the complex racial and gender politics of the U.S., through a series of guiding questions:

AMCULT 404 - Latinas/os in the U. S.: Social Problems and Social Issues
Latinas/os are now the largest minority group in the U. S. -- around 18 % of the population. While the media and census data tend to depict them as homogeneous "Hispanics," they are really a very heterogeneous group. In this course, we consider some of the major groups: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central Americans, Venezuelans, and Colombians. We examine their contrasting social characteristics (social class of origin, race/ethnicity, gender, legal status) that are the result of their different reasons for migration; different processes of incorporation; and different social outcomes in the U. S. We particularly look at the various histories that led them to come to the U.S., the impact the legal system had on their processes of incorporation (as undocumented migrants vs. refugees vs. professional migrants), and the opportunities available to them in various regions of the country during the historical moment when they arrived in the U.S.

# COURSE
AMCULT 405 - Topics in American Culture
In the 1920s, elite colleges across the northeast introduced quotas restricting the percentage of Jewish students on their campuses. As a result, many children from east coast immigrant families looked west to the University of Michigan -- establishing a long tradition of a robust national Jewish student presence in Ann Arbor. U-M has thus served as an important locus for Americanization and the development of American Jewish culture. As outsiders and eventually as insiders, the experience of Jews at UM captures the long history of tension regarding inclusion and exclusion in American higher education.

# COURSE
AMCULT 410 - Ethics and Information Technology
This course explores the ethical dilemmas that exist where human beings, information objects, and information systems interact. The course introduces students to a variety of ethical models from historical and cross-cultural perspectives and then explores the relevance of these models to a variety of new and emerging technologies that are inherently social in their construction and use. Initial examples of issues that the course covers include interpersonal engagement through online games and virtual environments, maintaining the integrity of digital content in a networked world, and balancing trade offs between secrecy (security) and openness of code, data, and information systems. Students explore the technological underpinnings of associated technology systems, experiment with individual and group interaction with technologies, and examine the mechanics of ethical and unethical behaviors.

# COURSE
AMCULT 498 - Capstone Seminar in American Culture
This is a writing course that approaches liberation from an anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and anti-zionist perspective. What does liberation from oppression and exploitation mean? How can it be achieved, and how might past efforts inform present struggles for liberation? We will explore how radical social movements, past and present, have envisioned liberation and fought for a world without racism, capitalism, and patriarchy. Topics include: strategies for dismantling oppressive systems; the creation of alternative, non-capitalist ways of living; the cultivation of solidarity across struggles; and the problems of co-optation and suppression of radical movements.

ANTHRARC 181 - Past Meets Present: Discovering Archaeology
Have you ever wondered how the past shapes the present, or why the world as we know it has come to look the way it does today? This course is designed to introduce students to the story of humanity’s deep past, as told through great discoveries in archaeology. We will explore spectacular archaeological sites such as Olduvai Gorge, Lascaux Cave, Tutankhamen’s tomb, and Machu Picchu. We will also cover less-known sites and discoveries that nevertheless offer important insights about the development of human societies and cultural histories in different parts of the world. Through course lectures, readings, and written assignments, students will gain a better understanding of what factors contributed to social change in the past, and will thus be able to better reflect on the social issues of the present and the future.

# COURSE
ANTHRARC 284 - Aztec, Maya, and Inca Civilizations
This fun course requires no prior knowledge or background. The focus is on the rise and fall of the ancient civilizations of Latin America. Two major goals are to expose students to an anthropological perspective and to a comparative perspective. The geographic focus is on two key regions: (1) the ancient civilizations of South America (especially Peru and Bolivia); and (2) the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras). The South American civilizations to be studied include the Moche, Chimu, Wari, Nazca, Tiwanaku, and Inca. The Mesoamerican civilizations to be studied include the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, Mixtec, and Aztec.

# COURSE
ANTHRARC 399 - Honors in Anthropological Archaeology
You’ve collected data and read so much; how do you turn your research into an honors thesis? This seminar is designed to demystify the process of writing an honors thesis in anthropological archaeology and biological/evolutionary anthropology. During the semester, students will meet weekly as a group to discuss their thesis projects and learn how to give and receive constructive feedback on their research and writing. In addition to completing a draft of their honors thesis, students will also learn how to present their research in a conference poster and to a non-specialist audience.

# COURSE
ANTHRARC 497 - Museum Anthropology
In Museum Anthropology, we explore the complex and often contested role that anthropologists working in museums play in representing, researching, and collecting material culture from Indigenous communities. We trace the history of anthropology museums from colonial collecting institutions to places of community engagement and collaboration with communities of origin. Students learn about contemporary issues of representation, repatriation, and collaboration through case studies, museum visits, and conversations with members of the community of origin. During the Winter 2025 semester, students contribute to a community-based project that is helping make information on ethnobotanical collections from the 1930s accessible to members of the Hopi Tribe.

# COURSE
ANTHRBIO 133 - Fundamentals of Scientific Computing in R
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing using the R programming language. R is a popular and powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing quantitative information, and this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to utilize R in a range of contexts in our modern, data-driven world. We begin by learning to think like a programmer, developing core competency with analytical reasoning and training ourselves to attack problems in a logical, ordered way. Next we will learn the basics of R syntax and simple programming. We will then take a systematic approach to working with real world data, learning how to acquire, wrangle, explore, describe, analyze, and visualize quantitive information and share our results. The course is tailored for students in the natural and social sciences with little to no programming experience. Material will be presented in an accessible, interactive way, allowing students to build competence and confidence through hands-on, practical exercises that demystify the often enigmatic world of computer programming. By the end of the semester, students will have developed a strong foundational understanding of scientific computing and the ability to program in R, knowledge that will open up a wide range of possibilities for engagement in an increasingly quantitative world.

# COURSE
ANTHRBIO 342 - Nature/Culture Now!

# COURSE
ANTHRBIO 370 - U.G. Reading and Research in Anthropology
Laboratory training and work in the techniques used in various aspects of research in biological anthropology.

# COURSE
ANTHRBIO 373 - Humans and Environmental Change
Utilizing an ecological perspective, we will address basic questions of why and how humans evolved over the past 7-8 million years. What were the adaptive forces that our ancestors faced in variable landscapes and how has this shaped who we are today? To pursue these concepts, we need to adopt a multidisciplinary perspective, drawing from diverse fields such as biological anthropology, evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, paleontology, geology, physiology, climatology, and neuroscience. Initially, this will involve a scrutiny of biotic and abiotic factors that may have influenced early human evolution including local and regional environmental/climatic change, associated faunal and floral communities, reconstruction of habitat and dietary ecology, seasonality and foraging strategies, technology and innovation, the transition into a glacial world characterized by constantly shifting climates, and potential geographic and ecological barriers controlling the dispersal of early humans. While retaining a broad perspective, we will focus on some of the key evolutionary stages in human evolution, ultimately including the extent to which ecology can be linked to the evolution and development of social structures and the capacity for culture in modern humans. Finally, we will consider how human activity has altered the global conditions and pushed planetary boundaries to threshold or irreversible conditions, potentially leaving humanity in precarious and unsafe operating space.

# COURSE
ANTHRBIO 465 - Primate Functional Anatomy
This course will introduce students to the evolutionary history of the primate radiation, particularly the evolution of monkeys, apes and humans, through an analysis of primate anatomy. The focus will be on the skeletal and muscular anatomy of living and fossil primates and reconstruction of the behavior of extinct forms. The course will include use of the Anthropology Department's skeletal and cast collections. It is helpful if students have some basic knowledge of primate biology but this is not required.

# COURSE
ANTHRBIO 476 - Evolution of the Human Diet
The adoption of novel quantitative techniques by biological anthropologists has led to innovative and novel approaches to reconstructing dietary ecology in the past, including migratory patterns, early hominin adaptations, and life history patterns.  In conjunction with functional morphology, biomechanical considerations, and wear patterns, utilization of stable isotopic and trace element analyses have further contributed to developing hypothesis implicating diet as a key concept in human evolution. This course aims to provide an overall introduction and examination of approaches to dietary reconstruction, with a focus on biogeochemical case studies in anthropology and the challenges of designing, conducting, analyzing and writing up laboratory and field research in biological anthropology. It will include practical advice on how to develop feasible and interesting research objectives, select an appropriate research topic, and design protocols for collection of quantitative data. Each student will develop a research proposal that tackles some aspect of dietary ecology related to human evolution, building on elements introduced in the early part of the course.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 101 - Introduction to Anthropology
An introduction to the four fields of anthropology—sociocultural, biological, archaeological, and linguistic—exploring the diverse questions and methods each uses to understand what it means to be human. This course encourages students to think critically about human origins, diversity, and the many ways of being human across time and cultures.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 158 - First Year Seminar in Anthropology
What can we learn about different cultures, histories and social worlds if we pay more attention to smell? Centering our noses, this course explores the role of olfactory culture in shaping human experiences, practices, and beliefs around the world. Through readings, discussions, and smelly experiences, we will examine how people use, understand, and value smell in different cultural contexts, and how smell can serve as a lens through which to understand in new ways how communities interact with each other and with the forces shaping their everyday lives. We will cover topics such as the colonial history of perfumery, the use of fragrance in religious rituals, the race, class and gender politics of odor, and the smell of climate change and environmental siege. The course will include a “smell tour” of our own campus and the curation of our own “smell museum.”

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 226 - Introduction to Historical Anthropology
Cultural anthropology can be described as the study of how people “do things differently” throughout the many societies and cultures around the world; social history is the study of how societies and cultures have changed over time. History and cultural anthropology clearly have a lot to say to each other. How has “the past” become “a foreign country”? Through what processes did “so alien a Then become so familiar a Now” ? How are our present societies and cultures connected to our own pasts and to the pasts of others? What historical paths have led to the cultural differences we find around the world today? These questions are both anthropological and historical, and it takes the combined skills and techniques of both disciplines to address them. An anthropological awareness of cultural diversity also alerts us to the very real possibility that different cultures may have different ideas about “history.” How did the past happen? How “present” is it? How do we remember it? In writing? Through oral traditions? In other ways? How is the past inscribed in traces in the environment? How do social memories of the past shape cultures in the present? Are there conflicts within society about how the past should shape the present? How do social actors actively define and inscribe the past, perhaps in a struggle to control the present and future? How do conflicts over the meaning of the past reveal truths about social tensions, divisions, and processes in the present? In this course, we will study the convergences of anthropology and history from two angles: the uses of historical research to explain and illuminate cultural difference; and the use of anthropological research to understand cultural differences in approaches to history. Our objectives are to develop an anthropological sensitivity to the everyday workings of history, and to become more aware of how history is never “history” (in the colloquial sense of being over and done with), but is constantly being negotiated—and is constantly at work shaping the possibilities of our future.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 246 - Anthropology of Religion
An introduction to basic problems faced by religions and by the study of religion. Drawing on case studies from around the world, the course examines different ways people have confronted questions such as how one deals with an invisible world, what happens after death, why do bad things happen to good people, what makes life worth living, how can one obtain wealth and power. The emphasis will be on comparison, showing how very different traditions have dealt with the same or similar problems. In the process of examining these issues, the course also raises questions about the difficulties involved in studying other people's most strongly held values and beliefs, and the relations between tolerance and faith.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 298 - Topics in Sociocultural Anthropology
This course will explore what mental health and mental illness mean in different cultures. We will explore how for some people these notions are conceived from a biomedical perspective (“chemical imbalance in the brain”), while for others mental illness can be linked to witchcraft, envy, or spirit possession.  We will use anthropological concepts to engage with interdisciplinary readings (from social sciences to public health and psychiatry). Our exploration of mental health will focus on three main components: Ethics, Politics, and Social Determinants. Essential questions in this course include: How do we inhabit the world with a mental health difference? What can be done to de-stigmatize mental illness? What socioeconomic processes inform the lived experience of people with mental health problems? We will use films, podcasts, and literature to explore these questions together.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 320 - Mexico: Culture and Society
This seminar will look at culture and society in the large and diverse country of Mexico. The fundamental aim of the course is to give students an overview of Mexican history, geography, cultural diversity, and contemporary social issues. Themes to be covered include: the search for a Mexican identity (how culture and national identity in Mexico have been historically and socially constructed over the past century); cultural variations among Mexicans; region, "race", and ethnicity in the construction of Mexican culture; gendered views of Mexicanness and Mexican culture; the family or household and the community as centers of identity, social action, and economy; religious traditions and religious change; urban and rural views of the nation; "borderlands"; the disparate impact of globalization, transnational migration, and transculturation on communities and individuals across Mexico; and the regions of Mexico.

ANTHRCUL 370 - Language and Discrimination: Language as Social Statement
Who speaks “correctly”? Which languages are taught in schools? Who gets to be bilingual? In this course, we explore how language is used to construct and suppress identity, with a particular focus on the languages and cultures of what is now the United States. As we investigate the relationship between language and power across time and space, we will also make connections with our own life experiences and with current events. Topics covered include the intersections of race and ethnicity with migration, language policy, pseudoscience, media representation, and multilingualism.   This course fulfills the Race & Ethnicity requirement. As such, we focus on linguistic discrimination which is rooted in discrimination based on race and ethnicity. We demonstrate how language has been used to reinforce essentialized views of race, and how discrimination based on language can often be a proxy for discrimination based on race and ethnicity. We discuss how language has been a site of oppression at both the level of the individual and society, and make explicit the connections between individual-level processes and social structures, showing how interpersonal bigotry both reinforces and is reinforced by laws, policies, and other norms. This course is designed to help students make sense of the world that they are in by giving context for how we got here, while also encouraging us to imagine and co-create a better present and future.

ANTHRCUL 430 - History, Memory, and Silence in the Middle East
This seminar takes an anthropological approach to studying the past, focusing on the politics of history-making, the role of memory, and the silences embedded in knowledge production about the past. We will explore how the past shapes the present, how the present reinterprets the past, and the complex relationship between history and memory. The readings address key questions: Is memory a depository of the past? Is history a record of it? Whose past is preserved in memory, and whose is silenced? Drawing from critical theoretical approaches, we will analyze how societies remember, commemorate, forget, and erase events. Memory becomes a contested site where anxieties about identity, authenticity, and colonial legacies are negotiated.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 440 - Environmental Anthropology
This course offers an anthropological perspective on contemporary environmental problems in an era geologists refer to as the Anthropocene, addressing the following questions: What does it mean to live on an overheating planet in which change is ever- accelerating?

How are patterns of consumption and waste interconnected? How might we imagine new ways to live and thrive on the planet Earth? Readings include several monographs and articles posted online. Students will write four short discussion papers and make a short classroom presentation, among other brief assignments.

# COURSE
ANTHRCUL 458 - Topics in Sociocultural and Linguistic Anthropology
How do ideas about language interpenetrate ideas about social difference? How does social differentiation relate to different facets of language access and use? In this class, we will explore the historical, economic, and political processes that are involved in different axes of social differentiation. This exploration will consider closely how language and other semiotic systems come to co-articulate differences in social interactions ranging from the everyday to the institutional and bureaucratic processes that scale and amplify speech in consequential ways. This course draws on cases across the globe to highlight the complex, multiple, and specific ways language and social differentiation co-emerge across historical contexts.

ANTHRCUL 577 - Language as Social Action
The purpose of this course is to develop a a framework for viewing language as a social, cultural, and political matrix, and as incorporating forms of practice through which social relations, cultural forms, ideology, and consciousness are constituted. Through this perspective, analysis of linguistic practice can offer tools for ethnographic and textual research as well as for research on language itself. Topics covered include: models of language as action; the interactional construction of social actors and reference; meaning and intentionality; the role of language in a political economy, and vice versa (the political economy of linguistic forms); the relation of language to social formations and institutions; metalanguage and ideology; the emergence of meanings in interaction; the organization of conversation and other linguistic activities; the linguistic dimension of social and cultural stereotypes; performance and poetics. This year we will give particular attention to the following themes: analytical scales and metrics; the analysis of social events, and their relationship to social formations and linguistic practice. Methodological tools such as narrative and textual analysis, and conversation analysis, as well as the siting of research, will also be emphasized.

# COURSE
ARCHAM 228 - Visual Cultures of Ancient Rome
Roman rulers waged war with images, vying with each other in life-and-death battles for supreme control of the ancient Roman world. Cities were aggrandized from Britain to Syria with great marble monuments to Roman leisure and wealth. Private individuals set up complex sculpted memorials to family, inserting their loved-ones into the material fabric of the city's, and the Empire's, claim to stability and status. Meanwhile, Roman homes glowed with multi-coloured mosaics and frescos, mapped onto floors, ceilings, walls, and matched in the carved detail of wooden furniture, and precious trinkets of silver and gems. The Roman Empire was awash with a rich and lively visual culture. This course surveys these vibrant visual arts of the Roman world from the late Republican period, down to the reign of Constantine (100BC – AD 336). It explores Roman visual culture across the provinces, and in a range of social spheres: civic, funerary, and domestic, among them. Students will be introduced to major objects and monuments produced for Roman patrons, as well as to lesser known works, which remain intriguing for the window they offer onto Roman aesthetic and social paradigms. Through this survey, the course will address the problematic question of how Roman art is ultimately to be defined. We will pay special attention to the function and significance of prominent themes such as portraiture, copying, naturalism, and classicism in Roman art. We will also engage with the difficult issue of how our own instincts about art, and our taxonomies of visual production, may actually hinder us in our attempt to grasp the priorities of effect inherent in Roman visual culture.

# COURSE
ARCHAM 382 - Food in the Ancient World: Subsistence and Symbol
The course deals with the production, processing and consumption of food in the ancient Mediterranean world. Food is considered in its widest significance, as both biological and cultural phenomenon.

The role of food in relation to socio-cultural and economic developments is discussed by quickly surveying food procurement by hunter-gatherers, the introduction of cooking and the shift to food production in the Neolithic, and, finally, food redistribution in complex societies. The Greek and Roman world are the core of the course, exploring foodways across social, religious, economic contexts.

# COURSE
ARCHAM 425 - Hellenistic and Republican Roman Architecture
The course will cover the architecture of first millennium BCE Italy.

# COURSE
ASIANPAM 311 - Asian/Pacific Islander American Studies and the Humanities
Stories of undocumented immigrants are often couched in terms of silence and invisibility, using expressions like “living in the shadows” and “under the radar.” Many Immigrant rights activists, on the other hand, resist this silence and invisibility and see storytelling as a political act that makes the humanity of the undocumented impossible to ignore. This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”

# COURSE
ASIANPAM 359 - South Asian Diaspora in America
In recent years, South Asian Americans have become an increasingly visible presence in American popular culture, as writers and characters on TV shows, stand-up comics, and most recently, the winners of Spelling Bees and Miss America Pageants. Such narratives have filled a convenient script for the “model minority” myth of the U.S., while troublingly glossing over reports that are far more dissonant with narratives of the American dream. Instances of racism and xenophobia against South Asian enclaves have occurred in the 1980s, while racial profiling and violence against South Asians, particularly Sikhs and Muslims, by state and non-state actors spiked after 9/11. But for more than a century, South Asians have played a key role in North American history, at the center of legal and historical cases that changed the parameters of race and citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. This course will explore this long history — from the earliest settlers who arrived in the late nineteenth century to the effects of the "War on Terror." We will also consider how writers, filmmakers, and other artists have explored the experiences of diaspora and immigration, and the complex racial and gender politics of the U.S., through a series of guiding questions:

We will see the Solar System from different planets, look back at the Sun from neighboring stars, and travel throughout our home Galaxy even as we prepare to embark to distant galaxies and beyond. As we travel extremely far from home, we will find that we also have to move back in time to see how the galaxies, stars, the Sun, and the Earth came about in the first place. The physical concepts that we require to understand what we see will be introduced as we go along, and some of these will be used many times during the course. Online notes will be available during the course of the term, though students may use any number of standard modern Astronomy textbooks to supplement these notes and the class lectures.

ASTRO 206 - Black Holes: The Triumph of Gravity
Black holes are among the most fascinating concepts in Astronomy. A natural prediction of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, they can be described as a gravitational singularity inducing infinite curvature into the fabric of space-time. Thus, the relation between time and space gets warped near these objects, generating some of the strangest phenomena in the universe. Although black holes do not emit light directly, their presence can be inferred via extreme effects on their environment. Paradoxically, black holes turn out to be the brightest sources of radiation across the entire universe. Even more surprisingly, black holes can convert infalling matter into bipolar jets that accelerate up to a substantial fraction of the speed of light. In turn, these jets can profoundly alter the properties of the black hole environment on large scales. Supermassive black holes are thought to play a crucial role in regulating the evolution and overall properties of their host galaxies – akin to an object the size of a coin dictating the growth of a city the size of Detroit. This class addresses the most basic questions about the nature of black holes, their formation, observational appearance, and ultimate fate.

# COURSE
CLCIV 121 - First-year Writing Seminar in Classical Civilization
This course examines the distinctive and varied ideas about love, friendship and affinity in a series of major classical and early modern works of literature. Some of the works on our syllabus, such as Plato’s Symposium and Dante’s Inferno, offer particularly developed theories and definitions of love. Others suggest their definitions of love more by implication and illustration. The course will use portrayals of love as a way to become acquainted with major works in the European literary tradition, and the topic of love will serve as a springboard for discussion of many other elements of these texts. Examining how each of the works on our syllabus makes use of its predecessors, we will consider how later authors use earlier classical ideas to create surprising and innovative new forms. Along the way we will compare these authors’ quests to understand and describe love with modern conceptions.

# COURSE

# COURSE
CLCIV 345 - Slavery and Ethnicity in the Ancient World
What was it like to be enslaved in ancient Greece or Rome? How were individuals enslaved? What tasks did enslaved individuals perform? Did those who were enslaved resist their enslavement? How did slave-owners attempt to control those whom they enslaved? How slaveowners justify slavery? These are some of the questions that we will address in this course. Students will seek answers to these questions by analyzing a wide range of ancient evidence, including ancient texts and material culture (archaeology).

# COURSE

Why do people fight wars? What impact do they have on society? Why do empires fail? These are the central questions that we will be exploring in this course.

# COURSE
CLCIV 382 - Food in the Ancient World: Subsistence and Symbol
The course deals with the production, processing and consumption of food in the ancient Mediterranean world. Food is considered in its widest significance, as both biological and cultural phenomenon. The course begins exploring various sources of evidence, including direct archaeological evidence of food remains and preparation, analysis of stomach content in mummies and other well-preserved bodies, chemical analysis in pottery and human skeletons, relevant Latin and Greek texts and artistic representations. The role of food in relation to socio-cultural and economic developments is discussed by quickly surveying food procurement by hunter-gatherers, the introduction of cooking and the shift to food production in the Neolithic, and, finally, food redistribution in complex societies. The Greek and Roman world are the core of the course, exploring foodways across social, religious, economic contexts.

# COURSE
CLCIV 389 - The Philosophy of Happiness: From Ancient Wisdom To Modern Science
In this class, our fundamental assumption is that people and really all beings want to be happy and deserve to be happy. Moreover, figuring out what makes us happy or what makes others happy is a praiseworthy and meaningful question. This is not a class in "debunking" happiness, but it is a class about exploring happiness. It might turn out that happiness is not an authentic or compelling category for you: there could be other ways of describing how you want to live. With joy. With compassion. With empathy. With strength. With virtue. All of these ways of being happy are on offer. Happiness, despite what some people say, isn't just a matter of having a good mood.

# COURSE
CLCIV 436 - From Caesar to Augustus: Rome's Triumviral Period
The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE set Rome on an uncertain course as the surviving strong men of Roman politics jockeyed for position. Ultimately, only one would emerge victorious. It would take Octavian thirteen years to dispatch his rivals and another four to consolidate control. This course focuses on this brief but pivotal period, when Octavian, Antonius (Mark Antony), and Lepidus ruled Rome. Their official designation as the Board of Three Men for Consolidating the Republic (triumviri rei publicae constituendae) gives the period its name. These years are relatively richly documented, but the sources are so patchy and so partisan that Sir Ronald Syme, the most important Roman historian of the twentieth century, referred the period as “tangled, chaotic and hideous.” Most scholars prefer to skip over it, in fact. We, however, will work to make up this deficiency by taking a comprehensive approach, looking not only at the political and military history of the time, but also literature, art, and religion, and we will make extensive use of the resources of the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology.

CMPLXSYS 260 - Tipping Points, Bandwagons and Cascades:  From Individual Behavior to Social Dynamics
There are many situations in which how we behave depends on the behavior of others. We can be influenced by our friends and also by complete strangers. Social influence may be trivial and fleeting, or enduring and highly consequential. For example, whom a person dates or marries depends on both her attraction to potential suitors as well as the characteristics and preferences of the competition. Similarly, racially integrated neighborhoods often end up completely segregated due to the domino effect produced by the out-migration of a few less tolerant whites. In this class, we examine how interdependent behaviors of individuals can lead to some surprising and unexpected social outcomes. We will explore both theoretical models and empirical applications of social dynamics, including sexual networks and marriage markets, the formation and transformation of neighborhoods, the success or failure of social movements, and patterns of technological innovation.

# COURSE

COMM 101 - The Media, Past and Present
This class provides an introduction to the evolution and impact of the mass media and digital media on American culture.  Because the media have been, since the late 19th century, the major storytellers of our time, we will focus on the stories they have told us over the years, and provide you with important stories about the media, past and present. We will review the ideological, technological, industrial, and regulatory developments that have produced our existing media ecosystem, and consider how media content has, over the years, inspired considerable controversy over who should get to tell stories through the media and should not. Our goal is to provide you with a sense of the strong connections between the history of the mass media and their present-day formations and uses in the United States, and to provide you with the critical tools and language to deconstruct their storytelling assumptions and techniques.

# COURSE
COMM 102 - Media Processes and Effects

The class emphasizes research that has developed within the social science tradition. In that sense, it complements COMM101, which emphasizes developments from critical and cultural studies. Throughout the term, students will have opportunities to both learn and directly experience social science research on the uses and consequences of today’s and yesterday’s media.

# COURSE
COMM 159 - First-year Seminar in Media Issues
As AI technologies become more integrated into our daily lives, they are reshaping not only how different forms of communication are created and consumed, but also how we understand what communication means in relation to consciousness and creativity. From anxieties over plagiarism in academic writing to new modes of creative collaboration in fiction, art and music, from the reinforcement of biases in journalistic reporting to the potential for more inclusive narratives in media, the intersection of AI and communication has become a hot topic in popular media and press coverage on machine-human interaction. Beyond the hype, what do these developments mean for our current communication ecosystem? How can we critically assess the ways AI is being talked about, represented, and integrated into everyday life?

# COURSE
COMM 405 - Seminar in Mass Media and Mass Communication
This class will explore contemporary Chinese culture, society, and politics through the lens of media and communication. China is increasingly a topic in US media, but the frames used often leave little space for nuanced understanding and thoughtful analysis of such a complex nation. This course will survey the profound transformations that have occurred in China since its “reform and opening” policy began in the late seventies, focusing on both the domestic and global forces that have shaped China as we know it today. We will analyze Chinese media industries, technologies, platforms, regulatory systems, audiences, and content as a means of developing deeper understanding of contemporary China, and by extension, global media systems and practices. In the process, we will simultaneously explore notions of modernity, consumption, art and creative production, shifting norms of gender and sexuality, labor politics, migration, censorship, nationalism, and activism in China. This course is interdisciplinary in nature and will employ a range of theories, concepts, and methodological frameworks, drawing particularly from media and communication studies, China studies, cultural studies, anthropology, and sociology.

In a simulation environment, students evaluate and implement strategies for translating contemporary science into outreach and public policy campaigns. Divided into committees focused on understanding the science, assessing human behavior, generating outreach messaging, and seeking policy change, students come to understand how science is warped as it makes its way from researchers to policymakers and public opinion. This term, we will be examining the science and practice of sustainability.

# COURSE
COMM 490 - Capstone Seminars in Media Topics
We live our lives bathed in sound and music. Digital social media, apps, streaming playlists, music videos, and sonic materials clutter our heads and impress themselves upon our senses. Music encompasses key facets of identity in the modern world. At the same time, music remains elusive and its social and cultural effects uncertain. When archaeologists unearthed remnants of a 35,000-year-old flute in present-day southwestern Germany it raised questions. How was the instrument used? What response did its sounds stir for its user(s)? The finding confirmed that music, being/becoming human, and civilization are closely linked. Across academic disciplines, musicologists, historians, psychologists, sociologists, media and communication researchers, and others puzzle over the relationship between musical performance and consumption and everyday life. How can interdisciplinary study of music and mediation clarify the nature of art in the modern world, social life, consumerism, technology, and mediated and interpersonal communication in the digital age? This course draws on historical musicology, literature, sociology, and cultural/media studies to examine issues in music and identity in the U.S. from the late nineteenth century to the present. This is by no means a survey of all that could be termed “North American” music; It contains Eurocentric biases and gaps. We will concentrate primarily on commercial, popular music. Nevertheless, by using selected case studies, we will begin to develop critical perspectives through which to understand identity in the musical mix and to analyze music as communication in the everyday life of the past and present.

# COURSE
COMPLIT 241 - Topics in Comparative Literature
Using literature, film, visual arts, and other cultural documents, students will examine the multiple ways in which Jews in Europe, America, Israel, and the Middle East have responded to the cultural, political, economic, and social forces of modernity. By focusing on a variety of textual and visual material from the late 18th century to the present, students will have an opportunity to explore the processes by which Jewish culture has been shaped and re-shaped in the face of unprecedented new freedoms and persecutions. The development of Jewish life from the late 18th century to the present offers a microcosm for the study of race, ethnicity, and racism in the modern world and the course will illustrate how deeply embedded racial, ethnic, and religious discourses are in any discussion of Jews.

# COURSE
COMPLIT 300 - Global Humanities
In 1986, the late Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish wrote a poem whose opening line has become symbolic of resistance and hope in dark times. In Arabic, the verse means both “we have on this earth that which deserves life” as well as “we have on this earth what makes life worth living.” The coincidence of both meanings in this one line hopes to reinforce not only the value of disregarded lives but also the small joys and comforts that even those in a constant state of struggle and pain rely on to survive. The verse is a willful insistence on the small joys of life even in the most difficult circumstances.

# COURSE
COMPLIT 323 - Adapting World Literatures
“I think I have heard this story before…” You probably have! This course is all about how narratives travel across space, time, and mediums, finding relevance with new generations and audiences. Through the story of Antigone, we will consider how stories from Greek mythology, thousands of years old, show up all over the world in new cultural contexts. We will dive into the political and cultural contexts that impact the core of adaptations as we move from novels to their Hollywood adaptations with The Reluctant Fundamentalist. Finally, we will think about how worlds are built and rebuilt as we move from one medium to another, such as from short stories to video games and then to television (The Witcher, anyone?).

# COURSE
COMPLIT 350 - The Text and Its Cultural Context
In recent decades, comics have evolved into a powerful medium for telling stories about conflicts in the Middle East, whether through autobiographical narratives or journalistic reports. The accessibility of comics as a kind of global language enables artists to convey the heavy toll that political strife, revolution, and war take on soldiers and civilians. This course considers the development of comics reportage and memoirs through the famous examples of Joe Sacco’s Palestine (1993-1995) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2000-2001). We then explore comics concerning civil and interstate wars in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, comparing works illustrated from the perspective of Western travelers with those written by natives to the Middle East or children of refugees. We also contrast printed formats with online comics, such as the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Welcome to the New World,” asking ourselves how digital platforms have reshaped comics and our reading experience.

# COURSE
COMPLIT 374 - Literature and the Body
Even though we’ve been told over and over that this is the age of information, and that what matters is the delivery of data, not the platform that presents it, written language is not just information flow; it is also matter—ink on paper, hands on keyboard, the ever-expanding server farms that root the “Cloud” very firmly to the land.

# COURSE
COMPLIT 376 - Literature and Ideas
In this course, we discuss Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, neo-pagan, and folk horrormovies of the 21st century alongside readings in contemporary religious studies to explore howwe think about the supernatural today. Scary stories are a way to peer into the dark, and religioushorror shows us what supernatural forces a culture fears the most: demonic possession; curses;rituals gone wrong; uncanny technology; spirits and ghosts. Students discuss why religion andfear have always been entangled, and how the definition of both “religion” and “horror” arechanging in the 21st century. And we talk about what scares us, and why.

# COURSE
COMPLIT 438 - Comparative Studies in Film
This is a survey course, studying the history of Hollywood’s “invention” of America. From the moment of its inception in the 1890s American film has participated in creating a set of ideals about America that raise the frontier, the experience of immigration, the little guy, the small town and big city into the stuff of widely circulated cinematic myths. The genres by which Hollywood made its money--the Gangster Film, the Film Musical, the Screwball Comedy, the Woman's Picture and above all the Western were not simply deft deployments of the cinematic medium, but image-driven narratives each undergirded by such myths. The cowboy charting the destiny of settling, the urban warlord (Gangster) commandeering his way in the rough and tumble city, the small town girl dancing her way to fame and fortune, the little guy in Bedford Falls fighting the good fight against the big bosses of capitalism, these stories have become indelible to American popular imaginations and to the point where they fuse with American heritage, becoming part of it. At the same time Hollywood consistently explored American malaise: racial conflict, rural poverty, class inequality, the degradation of the assembly line, the “urban jungle”, not to mention the big moneyed world of Hollywood itself. We shall explore this double history of Hollywood films: its way of making myth of America, and also debunking myth by picturing brute reality.

DIGITAL 354 - New Media History
This class is a U.S.-based history of the digital. Today’s “new media” are cultural technologies of extraordinary complexity with a much longer history than we might first imagine. While first acknowledging that all media were once new, this class goes on to explore in-depth a more recent period in this very long history – the rise of what is often referred to as “digital media.” Computers, software, networks and the innovative social, cultural and artistic exchanges that occur through them have emerged from, adapted to, and actively remediated prior forms like radio, film, and television. At the same time, digital cultures have also introduced and spread new kinds of content and experiences across a range of networks and devices. The affordances of digital life feel ubiquitous today, but has it always been that way? We will consider the historical development of computers, the Internet, and the many social, economic, and industrial implications these contemporary technologies of entertainment and communication open up. Familiarizing yourself with this history will allow you to better understand current issues facing you today as a new media user and producer, and to integrate this knowledge into your academic studies, career aspirations, creative production, social life, and everyday existence.

# COURSE
ECON 325 - Economics of Education
In this course, we study the economic approach to the analysis of education. This course is designed to increase your comfort in interacting with and evaluating the merits and demerits of proposed policies (educational or otherwise). This class is useful for students who want to have a firm background in one of the most important ongoing public policy arenas, and for educators who want to serve as better advocates for effective educational reform. The economic study of education is heavily empirical, so we will spend some time introducing the statistical tools most commonly used by economists, and we will spend large amounts of time discussing the state of the art of the evidence in favor of, and against, many current educational practices. Some topics we will cover are: economic theories of educational investment and production, the interaction of markets with educational provision, and the role of education as the “great equalizer”.

# COURSE
ECON 395 - Topics in Microeconomics and Microeconomic Policy
In this course, we will study how people behave under different rules and explore how to design such rules to induce desired behavior.

# COURSE
ECON 490 - Topics in Microeconomics
This course applies economic theory and methods to the study of crime. We will use basic supply and demand principles to think about why, where, and when illegal behavior occurs, and what the government might do to reduce it. We will also explore the empirical literature to understand what incarceration and policing do, how illegal markets (and their regulation) work, whether policies outside of criminal justice matter, and how benefit/cost analysis informs decisions about crime prevention. By the end of the course, students will be able to use an economic framework to analyze illegal behavior, to read and evaluate an empirical paper, and to think critically about findings from the crime prevention literature. Although public discourse about crime often involves philosophical discussions about justice, this course will eschew such arguments, focusing instead on how individual decision-making under constraints helps to explain crime and its prevention.

# COURSE
EDUC 118 - Introduction to Education:  Schooling and Multicultural Society
This course argues that education affects the lives of everyone in U.S. society and that Michigan students can benefit from a close examination of how race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and class shape schooling
in this culture. Discussions in this class are not always comfortable because the topics are difficult ones, but students routinely claim that taking this course has been a transformative experience. When we
discuss today’s patterns of school funding, the effects of racism are immediately evident, and they take
on historical context when we consider the gendered schooling of the Colonial Period, the denial of
literacy to African Americans during the era of slavery, the powerful anti-Catholic sentiments that led
to the creation of a system of Catholic education in the U.S., and the boarding schools which attempted
to expunge the American Indian heritages of children. The historical context offers a somewhat
distanced perspective on racism and ethnicity, along with gender, religion, and class. Accordingly,
students sometimes take refuge in “that was then, this is now” with regard to issues of educational inequality. However, when the course turns to more contemporary issues such as theories of
intelligence based on race or assumptions made about students of Arabic descent or the experiences of
female students in math and science, it becomes more difficult to deny the ways that race or ethnicity or
gender contribute to inequality in education. Comparisons extend across time as well as across
populations. For example, learning about the recent increase in school-age immigrants and the
experiences of English language learners gives students a point of comparison with the role schooling
played in the lives of late 19th-century immigrants. Similarly, considering the educational challenged faced by American Indians and Latinos in today’s schools provides a synchronous comparative
experience. Overall, then, this course gives students multiple opportunities to consider the meaning of
race and ethnicity, to explore the various forms of inequality engendered by intolerance, and to compare
discrimination as it is enacted in response to many forms of difference.

# COURSE
EDUC 122 - Intergroup Dialogues
In intergroup dialogue, students will participate in semi-structured face-to-face meetings across different social identity groups led by peer facilitators. Though topics will vary by semester, topics may include race, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, religion, and educational justice. Through readings, in-class exercises with thoughtful debriefs, and participant journals and other assignments, students will explore their own identities, build relationships across different identities and learn about pertinent issues facing various social identity groups on campus and in society. This course creates a setting in which students engage in open and constructive dialogue, learn about themselves and others, and explore issues concerning intergroup relations, conflict, and social justice. Ultimately, the goal of this class is for students to develop greater intergroup empathy, develop skills to collaborate across differences, and tools to participate in social change.

# COURSE
EDUC 325 - Facilitation in Community Settings
This course prepares students to be facilitative leaders in campus and community organizations throughout their undergraduate years at U-M and beyond. Specifically, this course will focus on self-care and community-care as necessities for effective facilitation. By connecting facilitation to traditions of social justice education and activism, we’ll illuminate methods of care that past and present facilitators employ[ed] to create group cohesion, guide groups through challenging processes, and maintain and support their own wellness, as well as that of the community. The focus of this course is developing strategies for facilitating race dialogues beyond the university community. In co-facilitation pairs and with a pre-designed 10-week curriculum you will facilitate high school students through dialogues. Then students will spend 10 weeks meeting both as a practicum class with the instructors and meeting in a local (walking distance) high school facilitating the students in dialogue. Students must have some flexibility on Tuesdays for the in person high school facilitation; tentative times are Tues 10-12 or Tues 1-3.

Potential site placements include: Family Learning Institute, English Language Institute, Latino academic tutoring organizations, Ann Arbor Public Schools.

# COURSE
EDUC 471 - Topics in Higher and Postsecondary Education
In this course, students will develop a foundation in the sociological analysis of higher education. We will discuss the causes and consequences of higher education inequalities to explore how colleges and universities (re)produce them. We will also explore how experiences and outcomes can be drastically different across and within sectors of higher education, including across the degree programs students pursue at the same university. Course readings and discussions will center on how higher education is a microcosm of many of the social inequalities we see in broader society, looking at issues interconnected to racism, socioeconomic inequality and classism, gender and sexism, and elitism, among others. This seminar style course also aims to cultivate an intergenerational community of emerging scholars that focuses on in-class discussions, and invites students to ask questions and share their ideas anchored in sociological theory and research of higher education to make relevant connections to one’s own participation in college and in its relationship to other areas of society.

ENGLISH 124 - Writing, Literature, and Academic Inquiry
The Greek goddess Circe turns Odysseus's men into pigs; Eve speaks to the serpent; witches practice animal transformation in the dead of night: in each of these narratives and many others, women are portrayed as having an intimate, often sinister, relationship with animals. What might these stories tell us about the gendered nature of communication, power, or animality? Is animal nature beastly or beautiful? In this course, we will read a novel, a book of creative nonfiction, a film adaptation, and several short stories to explore how and why the representation of women is tied up with other animals. Through the practice of "close reading," we will identify figurative language, frameworks, and threads of imagery that weave their way through narratives of women and animals. We will pay close attention to the relationship between social and cultural status and the impact of race and class, noting the ways in which these topics intersect with discussions of gender and animals. You do not have to be a woman, a feminist, or a vegetarian to take this class; you just need to be a curious person willing to explore the relationship between these ideas through literary study.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 125 - Writing and Academic Inquiry
This class is about writing and academic inquiry. Effective arguments stem from well-formulated questions, and academic essays allow writers to gain deeper understanding of the questions that they are exploring.  In this course, students learn to create complex, analytic, well-supported arguments that matter in academic contexts. The course also hones students’ critical thinking and reading skills. Working closely with their peers and the instructor, students develop their essays through workshops and extensive revision and editing.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 140 - First-Year Seminar on English Language and Literature
“Tobacco-Free University” is announced on garbage cans around the University of Michigan’s central campus. About 200 yards away from the trash can in front of the President’s Office is a plaque set in the ground that acknowledges land transferred by treaty from the Three Fires Confederacy of Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations to found UM in 1817. What is the relationship between the garbage can and the plaque, both of which people walk past all the time and rarely notice?

# COURSE
ENGLISH 203 - Introduction to Language and Rhetoric
Our conversations in this course will impact the ways we look at the every day, every day. Rhetoric, after all, is everywhere. And we know that words matter. Sure, lots of us learned an old playground rhyme: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” While that may reassure an elementary school child, once we spend even a few minutes studying language and politics, or language and advertising, or language and just about anything, we soon realize that naming has tremendous power. Martin Luther King, Jr., famously defends his “willingness to break laws” by naming some laws just and some unjust; lives hang in the balance pending whether something is named murder or self-defense; selecting a category of racial or national membership on an application or a census poll has many practical consequences.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 216 - Introduction to Disability Studies
This lecture course, the gateway to the brand-new Disability Studies minor, will acquaint students with active lines of inquiry in the interdisciplinary field of Disability Studies, which foregrounds the perspectives and experiences of people with disabilities.

A handful of guest experts will bring their discoveries to the classroom, inviting students to think expansively on the cutting edge of Disability Studies research.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 221 - Literature and Writing Outside the Classroom
This course – part culture study, part art studio – will focus on ZINES! These eclectic DIY magazines reached their heyday in the 1990s, when access to copy machines allowed writers and artists a cheap means of production. And though an increasingly digitized world has led to a diminished presence of zines in contemporary culture, zinesters do continue to find each other on the margins. In this course, we will consider the particular cultural and political role of zines as we (quite literally) cut, paste, and compose zines of our own. We will ask questions such as: Why did zines become hubs of radical and anti-capitalist thought? What is the cultural significance of alternative media? What role do zine gatherings have in our 21st century world? Over the semester, students can expect to produce three zines of their own. Our work together will culminate in a campus Zine Mini-Fest on Friday, April 11, where students will be able to meet and trade with other zinesters. Participation in Zine Mini-Fest is required, so save the date if you enroll in this course!

# COURSE
ENGLISH 223 - Introduction to Creative Writing
English 223 introduces students to the craft and critique that characterize creative writing, both as a discipline in the English Department at the University of Michigan and as a profession. This course treats creative writing as a skill and a habit of mind that students can actively develop through disciplined practice. The course also encourages students to participate in the writerly community as literary citizens. In addition to doing copious writing, students read published work in multiple genres, attend local readings, and respond to one another’s creative work. Over the course of the term, students produce writing that demonstrates both deliberate attention to craft and reflective awareness of their own and others’ creative processes. English 223 prepares students for upper-level creative writing courses in fiction and poetry and is required for both the sub-concentration and the minor in Creative Writing.

# COURSE

# COURSE
ENGLISH 226 - Directed Writing
Registration only by arrangement with the instructor.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 232 - Introduction to Visual Culture
How is culture expressed in visual images? This deceptively simple question is the frame through which we will study issues of production, circulation, and reception in art and visual media. Because visual culture is a fluid term, we will cut across disciplinary boundaries and theoretical approaches to consider not merely the ideas and the reality depicted by images but, rather, how images work and what they do. Throughout, our focus will be on people, places, and groups who are and are not represented in visual images, taking an historical view from the mid-nineteenth century to social media and a critical view of the contemporary politics of representation. Put differently, we will look at what it means to be documented and what meaning can – or, perhaps, should – be ascribed to the undocumented.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 244 - Introduction to Literary Journalism
Over the past two centuries, generations of Black journalists have played a central role in shaping literary and political discourse in the United States. This course will explore the history, theory, and methods of Black journalistic writing in the US, with a special emphasis on works we might characterize as literary journalism, an increasingly popular form of artful nonfiction writing characterized by immersive investigations of the social landscape. We will survey exemplary works by acclaimed Black writers while attending carefully to the distinctive--and constantly evolving--characteristics of the distinctive journalistic tradition they have forged, its connections with other strands of Black literary history, and the features that have made it so effective as a catalyst of community cohesion and social change. Famously central to the works of Hughes, Baldwin, Faucet, Coates, Smith, Hannah-Jones and other writers we’ll consider are explicit, hard-hitting discussions of the meaning of race and racism and of the consequences of the resulting forms of structural inequality in the United States. These writers tap deep wells of personal experience of being Black in America in rendering – and reflecting on – the dynamics of race in social experience, resulting in a highly celebrated body of work integral to the evolution of racial justice movements in the US.Additional topics we’ll consider include the boundaries between fact and fiction in subjective narration, the ethical issues that arise in writing about other people’s lives, and the deep history of hierarchies that assign more prestige to fiction than nonfiction stories–and more to writers of certain backgrounds than to those of others. While not designed as a writing workshop or a “how-to” course, the class will provide opportunities for aspiring journalists to experiment with techniques and practice skills essential to the craft and possibly also to partner, through the course’s connection with the Detroit River Story Lab, with regional Black-run news organizations to develop and pitch story ideas of potential interest to local communities.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 260 - Reading British Literatures
Together, we will read a diverse range of British texts across the nineteenth century that interrogate the category of “the human” and what is categorized as the non/un/inhuman. Our main texts will be Frankenstein, Wuthering Heights, In Memoriam, and Dracula. We will consider things as broad and as specific as love, bodies, race, the weather, plants, rhyme, work, and the gothic.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 274 - Introduction to Afro-American Literature
In this course we will study the emergence and early development of African American literature, from 1773 to the Harlem Renaissance. We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 290 - Themes in Language and Literature
This course focuses on the literature of racial passing and the complex motivations that led some African Americans to cross the color line in the early 20th century. These performances challenge our essentialist notions of racial identity and highlight some of the extraordinary ways in which African Americans negotiated the social, economic, legal, and cultural boundaries of American life at the turn of the century.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 292 - Topics in Language and Literature
This mini-course, instructed by Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow Kunal Majumder, introduces students to journalistic writing, focusing on three core formats: news articles, feature stories, and opinion/editorial writing.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 304 - Ways of Reading Literature
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the discipline of literary analysis. We will examine practices of interpretation and some of the methods and approaches used in literary scholarship, as well as refine our skills in discussing and writing about literature. We will use The Norton Introduction to Literature, which provides a rich array of short stories, poetry, and drama.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 313 - Topics in Literary Studies
When you turn on your favorite sports network, you likely know what you’ll find there: attempts at predicting the future (e.g., who will win a game/series/season that hasn’t happened yet); 2-4 people arguing with each other about “legacy” (e.g., MJ or LeBron? who’s the biggest NFL bust of all time?); maybe commentators complaining about some element of video replay during a game or saying “it’s all cosmetic now” in the final moments of the fourth quarter. While sports themselves gratify because of how they surprise, impress, and physically move viewers’ and athletes’ bodies alike toward some essential quality of aliveness and presence, the “genre” of talking/writing about sports in the U.S. in 2024 is largely corporate-owned, monopolized, under control, and will rarely surprise, shift — or break — the frame.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 314 - Gender and Sexuality Studies in Literature
Before LGBTQ+ people "came out of the closet" in the late 20th century, how did they understand their feelings and identities? Before sexuality and gender were scrutinized by science, how was queer love interpreted and explained? How should we interpret their identities today?

# COURSE
ENGLISH 317 - Literature and Culture
What is the relationship between science and magic in the Middle Ages? How does the popular literature of the time depict that relationship? What can we, as modern readers, learn from these texts? From the 6th century to the early 16th century, the Middle Ages bore and witnessed significant intellectual, philosophical, and scientific advancements. Through rich textual networks, these advancements cascaded across the Middle East, through Italy and France, all the way up to the England, and they were often reflected in the popular and imaginative literatures of the time. This course will provide a survey of that literature— from Alhazen in present-day Iran, to Boethius and Dante in Italy, to Chaucer in England, and many more. While our main analytics in the course will be science and magic, this course will also offer questions of genre, philosophy and theology, text production, and language and translation. This course will require two writing assignments, as well as one discussion board post per unit.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 319 - Literature and Social Change
Stories of undocumented immigrants are often couched in terms of silence and invisibility, using expressions like “living in the shadows” and “under the radar.” Many Immigrant rights activists, on the other hand, resist this silence and invisibility and see storytelling as a political act that makes the humanity of the undocumented impossible to ignore. This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”

ENGLISH 324 - Creative Writing:  Poetry
Welcome, poets! The process of this intermediate-level poetry writing class is about next steps and trajectories, about craft development and possibilities, about opportunity and change, growing and letting go. Over the course of the semester, we will aim to further develop our skills as poets through the intensive practices of reading, discussion, writing, and revision. In this class you can expect to participate in numerous activities that will support your development as a poet: 1) reading and writing a weird, wide breadth of poems; 2) learning various poetic craft techniques; 3) engaging in thoughtful discussions of poems and essays; 4) participating with goodwill and constructive criticism in workshop sessions that support the development of you and your peers’ poetry. We’ll think about the world of contemporary American poetry and our relationship to it. We’ll look more deeply into and question what we know. We’ll do the work of exploring what language can create and mean; and hopefully grow in experience and daring as poets. This class is intended to help you build your confidence and skillset as a writer so that you can continue to figure out what the wild world of poetry means to you.

We will gain a better understanding of Anderson’s cinematic style, working method, and cultural significance. Through a careful study of all of Anderson’s films, we will gain new insights into film aesthetics, contemporary film history, and “independent cinema” as an industrial and cultural category.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 334 - Writing Sex: Contemporary Black Women Writers
This course focuses on the post-Civil Rights era, in particular the 1970s and 1980s, and the Black women's literary renaissance that occurred during these decades to explore how Black women took up these topics in their work. Literature and poetry will be paired with readings in Black Feminist Theory to deepen and historically situate our inquiries.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 340 - Studies in Poetry
The term "Global South" has become a sort of acronym for the nations of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and South and Central America. It also serves as referent to the nations that were former colonies of European powers and currently fall under the hegemony of the U.S. led global market economy and its military and political dominance. To read poetry from these nations, we will certainly come across themes such as anticolonial and neocolonial resistance, political oppression, economic and cultural dependence and the search for independence in both, as well as issues of racism, gender oppression, and social and economic inequities. We will also examine some of the esthetic and philosophical questions that poets from these countries have addressed amidst quests for love, community, individual freedom, and meaningful existence in an ecologically degraded world.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 341 - Fantasy
How far can you stretch your imagination? This course explores a broad range of fantastical works, drawing from many genres including animé, horror, fairy tales, environmental fantasy, Afrofuturism, magical realism, portal fantasy, and high fantasy. Considering popular works by storytellers such as Guillermo del Toro, Carmen Machado, Kelly Link, Nalo Hopkinson, N.K. Jemisin, Hayao Miyazaki, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ken Liu, we will investigate the cultural and psychological dimensions of fantastical narratives. We will also study common fantasy figures, forms, and tropes, such as the animal helper, the ghost, the labyrinth, and the voyage, discovering how they are reconfigured and granted new meanings in various works and contexts.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 343 - Environmental Journalism:  Reporting About Science, Policy, and Public Health
This course aims to give students an introduction to the world of mass media, with a strong emphasis on reporting and writing about the environment and public health. This class has consistently won high praise from students for providing personalized, hands-on training in improving writing skills. Students learn from two prize-winning journalists who have more than 40 years combined experience covering the environment and public health for media outlets such as The New York Times, Newsweek, The Detroit Free Press, and National Public Radio. Each week, the course focuses on a different topic in the news related to the environment and public health, such as urban sprawl, energy efficiency, climate change, environmental justice, sustainable development, garbage, the Great Lakes, and urban agriculture. Students hear from a range of leading experts on the topic of the day, learning not only about the subject itself but also about the process of journalism. Guest speakers are chosen to represent many points of view. They range from corporate executives to environmental activists, scientists, government officials, and journalists. Past speakers have included the executive director of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice; a state senator; the spokesperson for the Michigan Manufacturers’ Association; The Wall Street Journal’s Detroit Bureau chief; reporters and producers from Michigan Public; and a 60 Minutes producer, among many others. Along the way, instructors guide discussions about media ethics, interviewing skills, freedom-of-information laws, the Internet as a source of information, government databases, and many other journalism-related topics. In-class exercises include writing the first few paragraphs of a story about one of the guest speakers and selecting the best quotes from recorded student-to-student interviews. In-class critiques of student writing also point out the most successful writing techniques. All class activities are designed to give students a broad understanding of how the mass media operates while also sharing tips on how students can participate in the mass media — either as full-time journalists or occasional dabblers in public discussions.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 362 - The American Novel
What does it mean to be both Black and bourgeois in the US? It is a question that becomes especially important after the fall of legal segregation in the 1960s, which allowed for an unprecedented expansion of the Black elite. This course explores how US novelists have represented middle- and upper-class Blacks, who have become increasingly powerful and visible in US life since the late twentieth century. We will consider how novelists have wrestled with issues such as Black class privilege and status anxiety, class conflict within Black communities, colorism, gender disparities, interracial romance, and the persistence of racial discrimination.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 370 - Jane Austen
When, at the end of the eighteenth century, Jane Austen began to write, the novel was still liable to be dismissed by serious readers and writers on both moral and aesthetic grounds. Austen’s achievement helped to transform the genre, helping establish fiction as the form that (paradoxically enough) explains reality and as the form that explains us to ourselves. In this class we'll read all six of Austen’s novels and study the contribution they made to the remaking of modern fiction. You should, in other words, exit this course having refined your sense of how all fiction works. You’ll learn skills that you can use in other coursework and that will enrich your life as a reader.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 378 - Muslim and Arab Literatures
Long a major component of Arab American and Arab Anglophone literature, Palestinian writing in English is increasingly evolving into a singular literary body. Engaged with questions particular to Palestine and the struggle for a Palestinian future, Palestinian writing has been spreading beyond its geographic and linguistic origins and gaining readers around the world, especially Western metropolitan audiences. Such a shift was necessary as the fate of Palestine and sometimes the survival of the Palestinian people in their homeland have been questions whose answers lay almost squarely in the power centers of the Anglophone world. Yet, while it has become a worlding literature actively bringing its concerns and artistic inventions to global spheres of influence, Palestinian literature, in English and translation, must by necessity remain rooted to its homeland even while it negotiates the tribulations of  diaspora or shatat (the Arabic world for scattering). Attempting to document nearly eight decades of anti-colonial struggle, massacres, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and anticolonial resistance, Palestinian literature has also had to struggle with issues of individual freedom as well as racism, and gender and class equality. Given these circumstances, Palestinian writing is steeped in layered critiques from anti-imperialist and postcolonial discourses, to feminist criticism, to the fine points of esthetic and poetic theory, which have made it a rich, multi-faceted, and absorbing body of literature worth examining in depth.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 384 - Caribbean Literature
“Caribbean Women Writers” introduces upper-level undergraduates to the literary works of 20th and 21st-century women writers of the English and French Caribbean, focusing on Haiti, Jamaica, other islands, and Afro-Caribbean diasporic communities in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 403 - Topics in Language and Rhetorical Studies
Well-behaved women, it is said, seldom make history. But those who don’t “behave” often have their contributions erased as well! This class examines the rhetoric of American women activists, reformers, and artists in and around the Progressive era (c. 1890-1920), women whose writing, speech, and behavior were frequently seen as a danger to the social order. The Progressive era was one of the most intense periods of citizen activism in American history, holding inspirational and cautionary lessons for our own.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 407 - Topics in English Language and Literature
This course introduces students to key texts and debates at the intersection of global works of literature and international human rights. Increased recognition of universal rights for all human beings is broadly understood to be one of the most important moral and political developments of the last century. In turn, many scholars have contended that a belief in human rights is grounded in the reading and writing of literature. To test these claims, students in this class work with literary texts as a means of investigating the historical origins, present challenges, and potential future of human rights as a framework for global justice and human flourishing.

ENGLISH 408 - Varieties of English
A study of the ways our speech reflects personal facts about national and regional origins, race, class, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, and sexual orientation.

# COURSE
ENGLISH 415 - Studies in Women and Literature
In this course, we’ll explore depictions of women as characters in texts composed and/or read in medieval England. We’ll also study women as writers; among our course texts will be the first books written in English by women. Medieval England was steeped in Christianity, so not surprisingly, many of our readings will have religious themes, including some surprising miracles of the Virgin Mary and lives of tenacious and daring female martyrs. But we’ll study a number of secular texts too, including poems about women who brew and sell ale and texts about witches. We’ll also read scholarship on these texts. The primary texts we’ll study were written in mostly Middle English (an earlier form of modern English), but also in Anglo-Norman (a variety of French used in medieval England) and Latin (an important language for intellectuals and the Christian church in the Middle Ages). Most of our primary texts will be in Modern English, but we’ll read some in their original Middle English.

As we do, we’ll ask what and who is remembered, how, by whom -- and why. Our texts will include literature, memoirs, films, eulogies, and community memory projects. We will examine the role of writing, purpose, audience, and "story" in remembering. We'll also discuss how writers frame and shape memories, how writers use evidence and outside voices, and how you can develop your own writing voice and style. We will make documents that chronicle, capture, depict, reclaim, amend, and even create memories. We will write four essays that will allow students to explore a range of writing that remembers and to practice and sharpen their research, interviewing, storytelling, and rhetorical skills.

ENGLISH 460 - Studies in the Novel
College has become an indispensable element of middle-class life in the United States. But what is the point of higher education? Why do we ask young people to spend four years of their lives studying the so-called arts and sciences in preparation for careers that often have nothing to do with either, at least on the surface? Is college an empty rite of passage, a mere process of credentialing, or does it–should it–involve something deeper? How wide is the gap between reality and our expectations when it comes to college life? In other words, is all this college stuff worth it?

# COURSE
ENGLISH 464 - Studies in Individual Authors
Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet has sold more than 10 million copies in 40 countries. Some have called it a Harry Potter saga for adults. But Ferrante does not build a fantastic universe of wizards, patronuses, and magical trains. On the contrary, the quartet’s portrayal of female friendship, motherhood, and family unfolds against the backdrop of a very distinct and underexplored Italian past. And yet despite being rooted in the particularities of Italian urban life, Ferrante’s saga has become a global phenomenon. What makes it so appealing to audiences all over the world? In this class we will read all four of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and discuss its peculiar place (and the place of Italy more broadly) in World Literature. We will pay special attention to how the Neapolitan novels challenge notions of authorship, especially with regards to female authorship, and shine a light on the crucial role of translation in the global circulation of literature.

ENGLISH 480 - Advanced Topics in Disability Studies
Introduction to Disability Studies is a cross-listed course suitable for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students from many different departments. Designed as an introduction to Disability Studies (DS) that is appropriate for newcomers to this area of study, the course engages with foundational texts and other artifacts across the discipline’s history, including more recent turns to Critical Disability Studies, Disability Justice, and related post-identity formulations. As we consider disability as a contested concept and DS as a methodology, we will also investigate disability’s various intersections with race, gender, sexuality, and class. Moreover, by foregrounding disability as a site of knowledge production, we will begin to examine the impact disability makes in aesthetics, design, political economy, and other fields. Students are encouraged to produce end-of-semester projects that explore disability’s resonances in their own fields of study. Course texts will be available as eBooks from the university library or as PDFs posted on Canvas.

# COURSE
ENVIRON 304 - Topics in Culture and Environment
“At the moment of Sputnik,” wrote the media scholar Marshall McLuhan in 1973, “nature ended and ecology was born.” But what does it mean that ecological thinking becomes possible just when the Earth is captured as an image at a distance? Typically, we tend to think of technology and ecology as opposed to one another, since technology is artificial and ecology, natural. Today, the widespread penetration of screens, sensors, wireless technologies, and AI into the fabric of our everyday lives challenges us to go beyond this artificial/natural dualism. This course will explore how the theory, history, and aesthetics of media and technology can offer multiple access points for rethinking interconnected human and nonhuman ecosystems without reducing the planet to human scale or to an artifact to manipulate and control.

We’ll study shapeshifters in film and literature, from Medieval werewolves to the Beauty and the Beast, from puberty to body horror, from fairy tales to contemporary journeys of self-discovery; what does it mean to slip into a new skin?

# COURSE
FRENCH 272 - French and Francophone Film, Media, and Culture
How are we impacted by the way that others look at us? How does the gaze of the Other shape our behavior, desires, values, and identity? When is it a violent, reductive gaze? Can it also be a liberating and empowering gaze? FREN 272 is an introduction to methods of critical analysis of visual and textual cultural production in the Francophone world. Through collaborative work with peers and formal practice in explication de texte, students will analyze how the gaze of the Other intersects with questions of gender, sexuality, race, and cultural difference. Objects of study include cinema, paintings, photographs, graphic novels, prose fiction, and critical essays from a wide geographical range (West Africa, Maghreb, Middle East, Caribbean, Europe).

# COURSE
FRENCH 274 - French and Francophone Societies and Culture
In this course we will investigate representations of animals and animality in a variety of sources from medieval France: literary texts and images, scientific and religious writing, and travel reports. We will ask how people conceived human-animal difference and similarity, how they understood the dangers of becoming animal-like, and the ways in which they used animality to characterize particular kinds of human beings. We’ll explore ways in which animals were seen to be like humans, or as models for human behavior, and we’ll ask how medieval people may have understood animals to live in a world of their own, separate from humans.

# COURSE
FRENCH 335 - Composition and Stylistics
In French: acquiring greater ease in writing French through creative-writing exercises. Following the French “atelier d’écriture” model, we will explore a variety of short formats that focus on one particular grammatical category or linguistic resource in order to shape the original expression of your ideas. Examples will accompany the exercises in order to illustrate the potential of each particular format. The course will involve weekly writing both inside and outside the classroom, writing which we will regularly share together. You will self-publish a book of your writing at the end of the semester. Counts for ULWR.

# COURSE
FRENCH 346 - Realism and Impressionism
This course focuses on Parisian visual culture during the second half of the nineteenth century. This is the period during which progressive painters, grouped loosely under the rubrics Realism and Impressionism, dramatically transformed the formal and thematic possibilities of their medium, despite stubborn resistance from the Académie des Beaux-Arts, the Paris Salon, and the general public. It is also the period that witnessed massive increases in the availability and marketability of print media, including photography, caricature, and advertising posters.

# COURSE
FRENCH 350 - Special Topics in French and Francophone Studies
We love fiction and we hate lies. We admire artists whose flights of fancy push the boundaries of our own minds to the outer limits of the possible and feel nothing but contempt toward those who seek to deceive us. What explains the difference? In a world where the virtual gets to occupy an ever larger share of our once material lives and where those who supposedly “tell it like it is” seem to have lost contact with the truth, it has become clear that what doesn’t exist does. In this course, we’ll enjoy our love of fiction but also probe our ambiguous feelings toward the false, the envisioned and the merely unprecedented. We will look at various modes of falsehood and invention, from lies and deceptions to vision and creativity, and ask ourselves to what extent taking liberties with the truth may actually liberate us. We will not, however, approach these questions from a moral standpoint—who and what is right or wrong—but, keeping in mind the meanings of the verb “fabricate,” think about what things that seem unreal do and how they do it: in other words, what we’re actually making when we’re making something up.

# COURSE
FRENCH 363 - Caribbean Studies
What does it mean to return to one’s roots? Is such a return possible? “Return to Roots: The African Diaspora in the Francophone World” introduces students to works by Francophone authors writing from and about/taking place in the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa. In this course, students will compare how these thinkers articulated varying notions of freedom, cultural authenticity, and faithfulness to their African roots. Through discussions of novels, cinema, and non-fiction writing, students will reflect on how national, regional, and continental identities have been constructed in contexts of colonialism, nation-building, and migration to and from the African continent.

# COURSE
FRENCH 399 - Independent Study
Readings and topical studies relating to French-speaking cultures (in Europe, Africa, North America, and Indian Ocean) not addressed in other courses, as well as to aspects of French and Francophone culture that may require special treatment.

By the end of the semester, you will know…

# COURSE
FTVM 203 - Media Production Mini Course I
During seven weeks of film screenings and discussions, this mini-course will look at the ways screenwriters, directors and cinematographers turn the city of Paris into a character. We will look at how silent-era depictions of Paris contrast with those of the French New Wave or with Hollywood films set in Paris. We will ask, why this neighborhood, why this street, why this bridge? And how is the art of cinematography deployed to tell the story? We will examine all the filmmakers' creative and practical choices that go into putting Paris on Film.

# COURSE
FTVM 210 - Introduction to Screenwriting
After taking this course, students will understand how to apply timeless dramatic principles to feature films, television shows, and new media by reading screenplays. Students will also clearly understand, through short creative writing exercises, how the elements of storytelling (characterization, point-of-view, subtext, symbolism, dramatic irony, etc.) translate to motion pictures in ways different from fiction and the stage.

# COURSE
FTVM 225 - Topics in Experiential Learning in Film, Television and Media
Course topics vary. Course topics will focus primarily on experiential learning in the field of film, television and media.

# COURSE
FTVM 272 - Classical Film Theory
This class offers an overview of the key terms and debates in film theory up to about 1970. Specific concepts include realism and formalism; authorship and genre; editing and montage. We'll also be exploring these concepts and debates as they extend to other media such as digital screen cultures and television — there are numerous exciting parallels between discussions about early film and the early years of television and digital culture. The course will include such theorists as Benjamin, Eisenstein, Vertov, Kracauer, and Bazin, and our screenings combine recent films with those that circulated when these and other theorists were writing.

# COURSE
FTVM 290 - Introduction to Media Production
This course is a hands-on survey course in media production introducing television, digital video, and film. Students gain firsthand experience in strategies and techniques of scripting and pre-production, production, and post-production, as well as a fundamental understanding of the aesthetics and processes of film, video, and television production.

# COURSE

# COURSE
FTVM 303 - Media Production Mini Course II
Creative Audio Design is a project-based, audio production course. All aspects of audio design from recording to the basics of editing and mixing are central to this course. Students will work in groups and individually to record in the field and in controlled settings to consider ways audio is essential to film, television and digital media. The aim of this course is to tackle the challenges of audio design and to develop a deeper understanding of the potentials of sound in a range of media contexts. Emphasis is also placed upon the creative process and students will have the opportunity to produce personal work during the term.

# COURSE
FTVM 304 - Topics in Media Production I
This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of film financing, festivals, and distribution that are necessary to understand in order to bring a story to the screen. By examining the finance models available for U.S. independent feature films, and the current distribution landscape, students will learn how to identify the artistic merit and economic viability of a project and gain an understanding of the critical issues facing independent filmmakers, including rapidly changing business models, the fight for audience attention, and career sustainability.

# COURSE
FTVM 310 - Screenwriting I:  The Feature Script
“To make a great film you need three things – the script, the script, and the script.”-- Alfred Hitchcock.

# COURSE
FTVM 321 - Iranian Cinema: Re/Presenting a Nation
This seminar course is an overview of the century-long history of Iranian cinema, beginning with the first films that came out of the encounter with Europe and up to the celebrated place it holds in the world today. Our focus is on feature films made in Iran, although documentaries about Iran and films made in diaspora will also be taken into consideration. The films are contextualized with lectures and readings that highlight critical themes in modern Iranian history, including colonialism, nationalism, race and ethnicity, the performance and politics of gender, international relations, the struggle for (self-)representation, social protest, and revolution. Students who take this course can expect to gain not only a firm grasp of the major figures and movements in Iran's cinematic history, but also exposure to some major theoretical approaches within this field: formal analysis, genre, gender, and the gaze, the role of women behind and before the camera, the formation of modern subjectivity, political media work, postcolonial studies, hyphenation and hybridity, and the global frameworks of "(inter-)national," "(third-)world," and "accented" cinema

# COURSE
FTVM 334 - Race, Gender, Sexuality and U.S. Culture in Video Games
Video games are one of the most widespread, profitable, and influential cultural forms in the U.S. Their rise to cultural dominance comes about at the same time as changing notions of race and gender in the U.S., such as liberal multiculturalism, the feminist movement, post-racialism, post-feminism, and a growing multiracial population. This course will avoid categorizing games as having positive or negative social effects, instead focusing on how race and racism have been expressed in a variety of types and styles of video games; how video games function as a window into U.S. race relations. We will look at the history, theory, and practice of video games in the U.S. with particular attention to racial stereotyping, user demographics, racial conflict in shared world and social games. The class will end with an examination of “serious” games and the potential of game texts, environments, and communities to help remediate social inequality.

# COURSE
FTVM 350 - The Silent Screen
This semester, we will look closely at the work of Georges Méliès, a pioneer of cinematic special effects and storytelling films. In addition to studying Méliès' extraordinary multimedia body of work in historical context, we will work to better understand some of the methods of early filmmaking through research-based practice assignments that put us in the shoes of turn-of-the-twentieth-century film creators. We will attempt to replicate the artistry of one of Méliès' trick films in analog 35mm film and digitally with the full affordances of the Duderstadt Center Video Studio.

# COURSE
FTVM 354 - New Media History
This class is a U.S.-based history of the digital. Today’s “new media” are cultural technologies of extraordinary complexity with a much longer history than we might first imagine. While first acknowledging that all media were once new, this class goes on to explore in-depth a more recent period in this very long history – the rise of what is often referred to as “digital media.” Computers, software, networks and the innovative social, cultural and artistic exchanges that occur through them have emerged from, adapted to, and actively remediated prior forms like radio, film, and television. At the same time, digital cultures have also introduced and spread new kinds of content and experiences across a range of networks and devices. The affordances of digital life feel ubiquitous today, but has it always been that way? We will consider the historical development of computers, the Internet, and the many social, economic, and industrial implications these contemporary technologies of entertainment and communication open up. Familiarizing yourself with this history will allow you to better understand current issues facing you today as a new media user and producer, and to integrate this knowledge into your academic studies, career aspirations, creative production, social life, and everyday existence.

# COURSE
FTVM 366 - Topics in Film, Television and Popular Culture
This course offers a critical introduction to filmmakers from the global south. We will analyze each filmmaker’s narrative and stylistic choices while situating their work in a larger historical and industrial context. We will study a rich and generically diverse body of cinema emanating from non-western contexts, including diasporic works. In doing so, we will trace the specific strategies of film style and narration that defined each filmmaker’s approach to cinema and how it affected the local and global audiences. With auteur theory as our starting point, we will examine how these filmmakers compel us to rethink the definition of film canons and authorship. This class will pay close attention to the politics of admission, who gets to be part of the hallowed halls of fame, and how selection rationales present a politics of exclusion that canonizes some works as art while marginalizing others. More importantly, filmmaking being a collective endeavor, how do we understand a model that reduces the effort to a singular vision, that of the director. We will also be attentive to the complexity of applying a western film theory to frame the work of filmmakers outside of western industrial and socio-political contexts. Some filmmakers we will study in this class include Meera Nair, Jafar Panahi, Ann Hui, and Lucretia Martel. Students will create a podcast project focused on a filmmaker of their choice at the end of the course.

# COURSE
FTVM 375 - Television Theory and Criticism

# COURSE
FTVM 404 - Topics in Media Production II
Following the tradition of the Independent Filmmaker, The Indie Lab II will focus on self-directed and individual approaches to filmmaking. Over the course of the semester, each student will develop, write, and be the primary creative mind driving the production and postproduction of their short film. All methods and genres of filmmaking are welcome. Students will be challenged to consider the perspective of filmmaker-as-artist, to think about their own creative voice and influences, gain experience being the central creative author of their film and learn how to thoughtfully discuss the content of their work alongside its form.

# COURSE
FTVM 410 - Screenwriting II: The Rewrite
This course focuses on the most important step in learning to write a screenplay: rewriting. The class is designed to help students embrace the difficult lesson of "letting go" of material from their first drafts to improve their work. The semester begins with students casting a critical eye on their fellow students' screenplays by writing coverage that will break down scripts into their fundamental elements and offer notes for improvement. Using feedback from fellow students and the instructor, students will then devise a new game plan (in the form of a detailed outline) for their second drafts and then execute it by meeting a series of writing deadlines. Equipped with an understanding that rewriting does not end with a second draft, students will receive detailed notes from the instructor to write their third drafts and beyond. Ultimately, students will learn that "writing is rewriting," a lesson they can apply to any discipline in order to transform good work into great work.

# COURSE
FTVM 411 - Writing for Television II: Pilots
"Writing for Television II: Pilots" offers students who have succeeded in Writing for Television I the opportunity to conceive and develop their own television program, from the creation of a "show bible" to the completion of a full-length spec script of the pilot episode. Students study and review well-known pilots with an eye towards how they accomplish the goals of a pilot: to tell a good stand-alone story while creating the potential for a whole world of continuing stories and characters that can be sustained over multiple seasons. They then compile a 6-7 page "pitch bible", consisting of a series overview, character profiles, and future episode ideas, then produce two drafts of the script. During the course, students will often be involved in workshop sessions, critiquing one another's work.

# COURSE
FTVM 427 - Screenwriting III
This advanced screenwriting seminar is a pure writers' workshop where students will write their second original, feature-length screenplay. The course is designed to instill a true writer's discipline in all students and to wean them from the classroom as they pursue their writing passion beyond graduation. Students have specific weekly deadlines they must meet no less than 48 hours before class, and all pages will be distributed to the class as a whole at that time. Students must come prepared to discuss their classmates' work and to absorb the feedback they are given. Students are expected to address and implement these notes as they move forward each week. In addition, students will have their work evaluated in masterclasses by special visiting guest artists from the film industry. Students will respect this opportunity by presenting their work in proper format and free of any typos and grammatical errors. Students will be ready to further articulate their stories in these sessions. As part of the course, students will learn ways to move forward in terms of potential writing careers as well as what the life of a professional writer entails.

# COURSE
FTVM 441 - National Screens
The Fantastique, derived from the Greek words for ghost and imagination, is a genre of film associated with the magical, the supernatural, the occult, and the folkloric. Its aesthetic roots are located in the Surrealist and Expressionist traditions, and its sense of poetry and enchantment moored to the legacy of Melies. The form’s narrative pathways often involve the brutal intrusion of mystery and nightmare into a decidedly realist register, an intersection which runs parallel to the milieu of magical realism. In its most extreme form, the Fantastique embodies the triumph of madness and moral depravity over rationalism and the laws of science. The genre’s cruelest transgressions often invoke the tableaux of suffering enacted in the Grand Guignol, popularized in Parisian theaters in the first half of the 20th Century.

# COURSE
FTVM 455 - Topics in Film Studies
This course explores Hollywood cinema in the 1970s, a decade that experienced massive shifts in American culture and politics. Taking a broad historical view, we will examine the institutional factors that fostered the increasing dominance of Hollywood over independent cinemas as well as the innovations in production and post-production technologies that radically altered film form. Throughout the course we will also pay close attention to the concept of film genre in order to reveal the ideological breaks and continuities between classical and post-classical narrative film.

# COURSE
FTVM 480 - Internship
In this course students work, under careful supervision, in some part of the media industry. Students work in some aspect of preproduction, production, or postproduction, in the creative or business areas of media, documenting their experiences and learning in a journal that must be submitted for final credit.

GERMAN 228 - Second Year Yiddish II
This year we will continue the course of study we began last year. Emphasis will shift slightly towards reading and speaking. We will read and discuss more complicated texts and continue class correspondence.

# COURSE
GERMAN 231 - Second-Year Course
What does it mean to be German? How do Germans see themselves? How does the world view the Germans? What about the Austrians and the Swiss? Chances are, if you have had any contact with German-speaking culture, you have probably encountered the question of German identity. In fact, there is even a word that describes Germany’s image: das Deutschlandbild. Try Googling: “Was ist (typisch) deutsch?” or “Deutschlandbild” and marvel at the multitude of articles and surveys. Why do Germans so frequently ask such questions about themselves? Is it because of the relatively late founding of the German state in 1871? the brutal use of racial criteria for citizenship under Nazi rule? the country’s division into two vastly different and opposing political systems during the Cold War? the challenges with reunification? Germany’s role in the EU? the current debates surrounding the admission of refugees? How do most Austrians and Swiss see themselves in relation to Germany?

# COURSE
GERMAN 232 - Second-Year Course
Food in German-speaking Europe is more than Bratwurst, Sauerkraut, and Spätzle. In this course, you’ll dive into the diverse and delicious food culture across Germany and some of its German-speaking neighbors, exploring everything from traditional recipes to the modern, multicultural flavors that define today’s cuisine. You’ll discover how dishes reflect cultural values, which role food plays in festivities around the year, how it impacts our health and environment, and how it is portrayed in the media. Learn about regional specialties, contemporary cooking methods, and the stories behind some of the most beloved meals in German-speaking Europe.

# COURSE
GERMAN 234 - German Grammar
The goal of this course is to improve your confidence with German grammar to enhance writing in other German courses. This course will include interactive instruction followed by discussion where students can get their questions answered about any grammar topic.

# COURSE
GERMAN 303 - Topics in German Culture and the Arts
Central Europe belongs to those unique historical amalgams whose composition defies disciplinary boundaries. The course traces this region’s complex history, culture, and its current spirit. Central European literature, theater, film, and visual arts will be examined against the background of the tumultuous and often tragic events which left marks on the culture of Czechs, Germans and Jews during the 20th century. Symbiosis of these ethnic groups and their linguistic diversity will be discussed. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of Jewish culture in Central Europe. Jewish emancipation, disappearance of ghettos; antisemitism and the Holocaust are among the topics. Another topic is the resistance against the Communist order and its eventual disintegration in 1989 as documented by works inspired by the fall of the Berlin wall. Authors to be read include Prague’s Jewish legends, Hašek’s Good Soldier Švejk, Kafka’s Trial, K. Capek’s drama Rossum’s Universal Robots, Kundera’s Joke, J. Roth’s Bust of the Emperor; films include Wegener’s Golem, Hippler’s Eternal Jew, and Forman’s Firemen’s Ball.

# COURSE
GERMAN 323 - Environmentalism and Ecocriticism
Nature and the environment feature prominently in the philosophy and cultural traditions of the German-speaking world—from the deification of nature within Romantic poetry and painting, through the blood-and-soil ideology of the Nazis, to the land art of Joseph Beuys and Hans Haacke during the Cold War. Today, German, Austrian, and Swiss people are considered some of the world’s most environmentally conscious, a fact reflected in the extent to which environmental issues currently shape the political agendas of their respective countries.

# COURSE
GERMAN 326 - Intermediate German
Embark on an exciting journey through the vibrant tapestry of pop culture in German-speaking society, spanning the 20th and 21st centuries from the electrifying Roaring 1920s to the contemporary Generation Z. With each era, we will immerse ourselves in the rhythmic evolution of music, the kaleidoscope of fashion, and the fascinating world of social media in order to unravel the intricate interplay between these trends and the ever-shifting sands of society and economics. We'll not only unveil how societal shifts shape these trends but also how these trends leave an indelible mark on society itself.

# COURSE
GERMAN 361 - Readings in German
This post-proficiency Readings course, taught exclusively in German, focuses on 20th and 21st century Berlin as seen through the filter of journalistic, autobiographical and fictional texts, as well as the visual arts and film. We examine the city’s perpetual struggle to redefine itself over the course of the last century: from its emergence as a world city and cultural hub in the 1920s, to its decline following the economic crash of 1929 and descent into fascism and war; from its reemergence out of the ruins, through Cold-war division and unification, to its current incarnation as an international city with a complexly layered past and present-day challenges. Through different narrative lenses—tragic, nostalgic, comical, journalistic ironic—students explore a wide range of topics: revolution, gender politics, political ideology and private life, youth culture, music as protest, utopian and dystopian visions, multiculturalism. Readings include work by Georg Simmel, Irmgard Keun, Hans Fallada, Peter Schneider, Thomas Brussig, Zafer Senocak and Jenny Erpenbeck.

# COURSE
GERMAN 388 - Topics in German Literature
Within the annals of German literature and film little is mentioned of the science fiction and fantasy genres. Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) and Frau im Mond (1929) as well as Alfred Doeblin's Berge Meere und Giganten (1924) reflect a general interest in the genre before World War II. After the war the genre fills with English language titles from such masters as Heinlein, Asimov and Tolkien. Yet there existed a lively audience for science fiction in the 1950's with such publications as Terra and Perry Rhodan. From the 1970's onward, German science fiction and fantasy once again gains traction in regional bookstores and theaters, but rarely garners the international acclaim or status of the aforementioned English language titles.

# COURSE
GERMAN 396 - Germany and the Black Diaspora
Germany is a country not often associated with the African diaspora, but what students in this class will learn, is that people of African descent have long been a part of Central European history. From Black saint iconography in medieval churches to entertainers such as Josephine Baker or Beyoncé in Berlin, Germans have long engaged with, and responded to, Black figures in European history. In so doing, they have participated in global conversations on nationalism, colonialism, race, and gender. In this class we will examine Germany’s Black pasts in general, and Afro-German history specifically, all with an eye toward interrogating the creation and interpretations of Black collective identities. In so doing, we will analyze the pitfalls and advantages of adopting U.S. theoretical paradigms to engage with issues of Black communities beyond U.S. borders, as well as broaden our understanding of the cultural and historical diversities among Germany’s Black population.

# COURSE
GERMAN 416 - Seminar in German Studies
The course is designed to be a forum where students can improve their language skills in the areas of speaking and writing, as well as reading and listening comprehension. Students read and discuss a variety of German-language literary works, with an emphasis on close reading and understanding of content and intent. Students read and discuss five possibly canonical, most certainly popular and influential poems in modern German literature, before proceeding to read a selection of three shorter, popular and entertaining Erzählungen and Kurzgeschichten. The second half of the semester is dedicated to the close reading and discussion of the deeply satisfying “tragic comedy” Der Besuch der alten Dame by the Swiss dramatist Friedrich Dürrenmatt.

# COURSE
GERMAN 470 - Workshop in Translation
This course is designed to introduce advanced German students to translation practices and theories, as well as to the business and advanced study of translation. In general, we orient ourselves around the professional standards and guidelines of the American Translators Association (ATA), so that students will receive direct experience with approaches to translation in a “real world” environment. The four primary learning goals of this course are:

# COURSE
GREEK 102 - Elementary Greek
Second semester introductory Greek. The second half of the introductory Greek sequence.

# COURSE
GREEK 302 - Second-Year Greek
In this course, we will be engaged in the exciting task of reading Homer’s Iliad. Our primary goal will be to become accurate and adept readers of Homeric poetry and, to this end, we will devote special attention to the grammar and syntax of the reading assignments. But we will also use our readings to encounter and discuss many other aspects of Homer, including the mechanics of traditional oral poetry, the major themes and issues of Iliad, and the ways in which this poem served as a foundational text for later Greeks. We will also become acquainted with the poem’s meter, dactylic hexameter, and spend time practicing scansion.

# COURSE
GREEK 473 - Advanced Koine
In this class we are going to read substantial selections from a variety of Koine Greek prose authors (a.o. Philo, Josephus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo). The key aims are to enhance students’ reading ability in Koine Greek both with respect to grammar (morphology, syntax) and to translating and understanding.

# COURSE
GREEK 499 - Supervised Reading
Regular reports and conferences required.

# COURSE
GREEKMOD 102 - Elementary Modern Greek, II
The course develops acquisition of the Greek language used today in the four language skills, speaking, listening, reading and writing at the advanced beginning level. It provides opportunity for practicing these within the framework of specific themes and functions in various basic situations. Students are given the opportunity to acquire an understanding of Modern Greek culture and society and acquaint themselves with some representative texts, songs, images and other authentic cultural materials of relevance.

# COURSE
GREEKMOD 341 - Greek Myth in Film
Ancient heroes turn up in unexpected places when you switch on a movie -- from science fiction to horror, from superhero adventures to comedy-dramas to westerns, Greek heroes, monsters, and myths are lurking at the heart of these genres. What are they doing there? This class studies the ancient myths at work in modern film and how the ancient past bleeds into our own present and our visions of the future. What happens when Greek stories land in modern or alien times and characters? What kinds of meaning can stories from an old, traditional, patriarchal, and utterly different world carry for modern viewers of films? What is lost or gained in translation? While we will be developing some awareness of myths in ancient contexts, greater attention falls on critical understanding of filmic storytelling across eras, cultures, and genres.

HISTART 194 - First Year Seminar
This course is designed to teach first-year students how to look at, think about, and engage critically with the visual arts and architecture. Taking a cue from John Berger’s 1972 television program and series of essays, Ways of Seeing, we will analyze specific artists, works, and buildings through the centuries. Our case-studies will take us from Athens to Persepolis, Florence to New York, and Paris to Chandigarh. The course will offer students training in analyzing the formal aspects of artworks and architecture, an understanding of the materials and techniques used, and a discussion of the political and social contexts in which artmaking is situated. While not a historical survey, there are chronological and conceptual arcs running through the course, which will enable students to draw transhistorical connections and prepare them for future academic and everyday engagements with the visual world that surrounds them.

# COURSE
HISTART 210 - History of Photography
Photography has grown up with modern life. Making sense of its history requires an understanding of its social and political functions, its integration with everyday experience, and its complex relationships to the history of art and the modern media. This course surveys photography from its public debut in 1839 to the present day and introduces students to the tools needed to interpret its varied uses and meanings.

# COURSE
HISTART 221 - Temples, Towns and Tombs: Introduction to Greek Art and Archaeology
Temples, Towns and Tombs! In this introductory course we explore what these and other types of evidence have to tell us about the lives of ordinary people. We ask how they were affected by the huge social and technological changes taking place over the long period covered by the course (ca. 3000 BCE to 31 BCE). This period saw the introduction of bronze- and, subsequently, of iron-technology; the initiation of trade over short and long distances; the invention, loss and re-adoption of a range of skills including the production of figurative art, monumental stone architecture and writing; and last (but not least) the rise, fall and re-birth of cities. We also explore the origins of various forms of cultural expression that are still with us today, such as the Olympic games, democracy, the writing of history, and the creation of drama. No previous knowledge of ancient Greece or of art and archaeology is necessary.

HISTART 243 - Introduction to South Asian Art: Art of India
Studying the visual arts of South Asia constitutes a gateway toward understanding the entirety of the intellectual and cultural heritage of humanity, from antiquity to the present day. The assemblages of objects and images produced and used in South Asia – Buddhist stupas, sprawling temple-cities, embroidered textiles, Mughal paintings, Satyajit Ray films and much else – represent more than the inheritance of South Asia, home to a fifth of the world's population. In addition to introducing these objects and images, this survey course will also explicate how they are equally the heritage of many other cultures because many of them have emerged from encounters with other mediums and with other civilizations, which, in turn, have been reflected, reshaped, and reformed by the art of subcontinent. This course includes field trips to art and archaeology museums in the Ann Arbor area and satisfies the LSA Humanities (HU) requirement.

# COURSE
HISTART 272 - Modern Art:  Avant-Garde to Contemporary
To quote Craig Damrauer: "Modern Art = I could do that + yeah, but you didn't." The course will survey twentieth-century art from Europe and the U.S. and investigate its novelty, profundity, and humor. We will cover the names you know (Picasso, Matisse, O'Keefe, Pollock) as well as works that you might not be so sure about (drip paintings, urinals, a woman hanging from the ceiling by a rope), all while developing a series of questions about the nature of art and its relationship to the social and political context from which it emerged. Not only will this course provide an overview of the twentieth-century, Western art, it will equip you with the background necessary to begin to understand the art of the twenty-first.

# COURSE
HISTART 347 - Medieval Sports and Art
Chariot-racing, tennis, football, archery, and jousting were just some of the sports enjoyed over the 1000 years (4th-15th centuries CE) known as the “Middle Ages.” Kings and queens, monks and nuns, nobles and peasants engaged in these in order to gain athletic prowess, fame, status, wealth, love, sex, and fun. This course examines the powerful visual expressions of the sports and games developed, and encouraged or discouraged over the medieval era. We will look at athletic monuments, illustrated manuscripts, tapestries, and relatively unexpected objects such as mirrors and combs. Modern material such as films and TV excerpts shall also be used. Key issues explored are: the spectatorship of medieval sports; gender, class, and religion in sports; the role of fashion; and comparisons between the medieval and modern versions of the sports played.

# COURSE
HISTART 370 - Realism and Impressionism
This course focuses on Parisian visual culture during the second half of the nineteenth century. This is the period during which progressive painters, grouped loosely under the rubrics Realism and Impressionism, dramatically transformed the formal and thematic possibilities of their medium, despite stubborn resistance from the Académie des Beaux-Arts, the Paris Salon, and the general public. It is also the period that witnessed massive increases in the availability and marketability of print media, including photography, caricature, and advertising posters.

# COURSE
HISTART 389 - Pompeii
In 79 CE the city of Pompeii, on the coast of southern Italy, was engulfed by the catastrophic eruption of the nearby volcano, Vesuvius. Parts of the city, and surrounding buildings and settlements, including the town of Herculaneum, were rediscovered beginning in the 1700s. The astonishing preservation of the streets and buildings of Pompeii has captured popular imagination ever since. This course will uncover the urban fabric of the city. We will look at how it was laid out, at public and private buildings and their decoration, and at the wider cultural, geographical and historical contexts of its founding around the sixth century BCE and its later incorporation into the Roman Empire. Using physical remains alongside texts in translation, we will explore aspects of the lives of the inhabitants, including entertainment, housing, religion, economy, slavery, political organization and expression, roles played by men and women inside and outside the family, and attitudes towards death. At the beginning of the course we will naturally focus more on background information on the site and its history; as the course progresses we will examine the approaches of current investigators to many problems posed by the remains. The course is ideally suited for undergraduate students with some background in classical studies, art history, and classical art/archaeology (e.g., an introductory course such as CLARCH 221 or 222). No background is required, however.

# COURSE
HISTART 393 - Undergraduate Seminar
This seminar, for advanced undergraduate students who are invested in thinking deeply and critically about objects (understood broadly to include all visual and material culture) and their historical lives, will explore the matter of art history: the questions that art historians ask, the methods that they use to answer them, and the stakes — political, disciplinary, and personal — that motivate and energize their work.

# COURSE
HISTART 394 - Special Topics in the Humanities
This course examines past and present-day contributions by artists of African descent to the vibrant traditions, critical debates, and aesthetic developments, throughout the history of art in the United States. Informing, and reinforced by, the country's emergent national identity, African American Art is a major locus for exploring intersections between art and Americanisms at national and international levels. Attention to the visual, political, and sociocultural dimensions of the country's art and artists begins with its colonial history and spans to the present moment, enriching understandings about an expansive array of media–drums, quilts, paintings, sculptures, installations, performances, sound art and more–that radically impact the challenges and possibilities of creative expression. Centuries of identity formation, war, politics, social and cultural change, economic shifts, and new technologies, will require active consideration of concepts that crucially inform knowledge production, including gender, nationality, race, and the cultural work of art across time.

# COURSE
HISTART 395 - Mini Seminar Course in History of Art
The practice of body modification in sub-Saharan Africa includes scarification, tattooing, body painting, and piercing. This seminar offers insights into the histories of African body modification from 18th century to the present. The primary goal is to investigate the symbolism of body modification through an examination of its visual vocabulary. We will analyze the interconnectedness of art, body modification, and cultural heritage. We will critically review the inherent value of body modification as a mode of communication within and outside of these societies. We will also explore the appearance of motifs from body modification in the context of architectural design and sculpture.

# COURSE
HISTART 489 - Special Topics in Art and Culture
The course focuses on interfaces of Soviet visual arts and political propaganda that characterized the years of Revolution, the NEP Period, and Stalinism in the USSR, i.e., the years between the revolutions of 1917 and Stalin’s death in 1953. Among other things, we will study modern print media, ranging from poster art to publishing projects such as the propaganda magazine USSR in Construction, but also phenomena which, although displaying distinct visual aspects, have largely been neglected, e.g., such as picture postcards, wall newspapers, and the like. Another major topic are visual aspects of public festivities and, overall, visual aspects of the public space. We will also discuss profiles of artists who were active in forging the bridge between the avant-garde and political art (Klucis, Lissitski, Rodchenko). Time permitting, some of these domains will be compared— and contrasted— with similar phenomena in interwar Germany, especially as regards the culture of photo-illustrated magazines, visual aspects of the public space, or the cult of personality. Western contributions to Soviet visual culture will also be discussed. Students unfamiliar with Russian history will be encouraged to look for phenomena of visual propaganda in other national cultures, including the present times; knowledge of Russian is not required.

# COURSE
HISTART 497 - Upper-Level Seminar
How did Americans learn to visualize race? How did certain groups resist others’ efforts to depict them? Who were the first Americans? Was the United States a nation of many races, one race, or an idea that transcended race? How did artists address these issues in the century of Manifest Destiny, Civil War, and the widespread display and reproduction of pictures? These are the questions our seminar will address as we design new displays and interpretation of 19th century US art for an exhibition at the University of Michigan Museum of Art. We’ll study paintings, drawings, sculpture, illustrations, photographs, cartoons, advertisements, and even some buildings designed in the United States in the period, consider the role of 19thcentury exhibitions, then rethink the way the Museum could display these materials today. We will work with archival sources on campus and visit the Clements Library and area art museums. Our readings will include primary documents as well as recent interpretations.

# COURSE
HISTORY 104 - Introduction to History in the Social Sciences
This course is an introductory survey of the making of the modern capitalist world from c. 1450 to the present. The advent of capitalism brought in its wake significant changes for different regions of the world while connecting them into what can be called a 'modern world system.' The manner in which different regions were integrated into this new world-system had far reaching consequences for their internal development and for their relations with the rest of the world. Our aim will be to examine the process by which the modern world-system integrated different regions during the historical stages of its development. We will examine the development of the modern world-system through the following stages:

# COURSE
HISTORY 195 - The Writing of History
This course teaches college-level writing skills through studying the history of magic, witchcraft, and ideas of superstition. You will build argumentative and reasoning skills while considering witches, sorcerers, fairies, and sometimes gods. It is a writing-intensive course with several written assignments due throughout the semester, including a substantive argumentative essay about the history of magic. The content will range from magic in medieval Christianity to the practice of magic in the modern day.

HISTORY 197 - First-Year Seminar in the Humanities
Different kinds of travellers across time and space have long returned home to tell of their experiences. But other kinds of journey and telling happen mostly in the mind.

# COURSE
HISTORY 201 - Rome
Who were "the Romans"? At its peak, the Roman empire encompassed the entire Mediterranean region—and beyond. No single state had ever consolidated this vast territory (nor has any since); to be "Roman" came to mean many things for the millions of people who made up this multiethnic empire. How did this happen, and what can we learn from it? The course will take a range of approaches to these questions, focusing on the second century BCE through the fourth century CE. Lectures will combine Roman political history with the study of culture and everyday life. This means we will engage deeply with topics such as gender, sexuality, slavery, domestic life, identity, and religion. Students will learn about the rise and fall of dynasties, the Roman frontier, and the tapestry of cultures in the empire, while also gaining a sense of what it would have been like to live in the ancient Mediterranean world. Discussion sections will focus on ancient texts and some modern scholarship, as well as art and material culture of the Roman world.

# COURSE
HISTORY 202 - Doing History
The course provides a structured and cohesive foundation in the analytical, methodological, compositional, and historiographical skills involved in “doing history.” Students will encounter a diverse set of primary sources in order to evaluate how historians identify and interpret the clues, evidence, and omissions in the historical record. Students also will read secondary historical texts on selected subjects, with a focus on historiographical debates over competing interpretations of the past and consideration of the various approaches of political, social, cultural, and other subfields of history.

# COURSE
HISTORY 205 - Modern East Asia
This course is an introduction to modern China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam from 1600 to the present, with emphasis on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It covers the following topics: China’s progressive decline and rejuvenation, the impact of imperialism, the rise and development of the PRC; the struggles of Korea, its colonization by Japan; liberation and division into the two Koreas, and the rising economic status of the South; Vietnam's last dynasty and its colonization by France, the World War and the Vietnam War; and the end of feudalism in Japan, the building of a modern state and economy, Japanese imperialism, postwar recovery, and the rise to super-power status.  Taking a broad comparative perspective on East Asia, the course explores the inter-relations between political economy, society, and culture in each country within an emerging modern world system. This is a continuation of History 204; however that course is not a prerequisite and no previous background on the subject is required.

# COURSE
HISTORY 211 - Later Medieval Europe, 1000-1500
In the year 1000, Europe was barely able to feed its growing population, and riven with the violence of competing warlords. By 1500, Europeans were crossing the Atlantic Ocean, trading directly with China, and powerful king’s ruled large territories unified by law. This course looks at how Europe emerged from the margins of the world’s stage by examining events like the Crusades, the Black Death, and the invention of the printing press, the rise of institutions like monarchies, the papacy, and human bondage, and by looking at long term changes to the medieval climate. We will also ask, who belonged to this emerging world and who was steadily excluded? Where did the idea of nations come from? And we will ask, what is the relationship between the real Middle Ages and the fantasy one that fills video games, white-supremacist politics, and the news media?

# COURSE
HISTORY 227 - The Rise and Fall of the British Empire
This course traces how a small island off the coast of Europe came to rule, at one point, perhaps as much as a quarter of the world. Apparently, the sun would never set on the British empire. It taught much of the world English, it carried the message of liberty while enslaving people in practice, it tended to and massacred, all the while trading and circulating paper, tea, opium, capital, sugar, slaves, guns, science and colonists. Clearly, the British empire was not limited to what happened behind closed doors but involved and affected common people across the globe, making a difference to what they ate and what kind of work they did, what they thought and learned in schools. The empire is too large to fit into one course, so we will be carefully selective. The purpose of this course is to understand the changing dynamics of the empire from the late-18th century onwards, both at the largest of scales, and the most intimate. Most importantly, this is a course about what the British empire looked like from the eyes of the colonized: how did they respond, negotiate, resist, and appropriate the British empire to manufacture their own political futures?

# COURSE
HISTORY 229 - Introduction to Historical Anthropology
Cultural anthropology can be described as the study of how people “do things differently” throughout the many societies and cultures around the world; social history is the study of how societies and cultures have changed over time. History and cultural anthropology clearly have a lot to say to each other. How has “the past” become “a foreign country”? Through what processes did “so alien a Then become so familiar a Now” ? How are our present societies and cultures connected to our own pasts and to the pasts of others? What historical paths have led to the cultural differences we find around the world today? These questions are both anthropological and historical, and it takes the combined skills and techniques of both disciplines to address them. An anthropological awareness of cultural diversity also alerts us to the very real possibility that different cultures may have different ideas about “history.” How did the past happen? How “present” is it? How do we remember it? In writing? Through oral traditions? In other ways? How is the past inscribed in traces in the environment? How do social memories of the past shape cultures in the present? Are there conflicts within society about how the past should shape the present? How do social actors actively define and inscribe the past, perhaps in a struggle to control the present and future? How do conflicts over the meaning of the past reveal truths about social tensions, divisions, and processes in the present? In this course, we will study the convergences of anthropology and history from two angles: the uses of historical research to explain and illuminate cultural difference; and the use of anthropological research to understand cultural differences in approaches to history. Our objectives are to develop an anthropological sensitivity to the everyday workings of history, and to become more aware of how history is never “history” (in the colloquial sense of being over and done with), but is constantly being negotiated—and is constantly at work shaping the possibilities of our future.

# COURSE
HISTORY 230 - Humanities Topics in History
This course considers various dimensions of military conflicts, not only battles and destructions but also modes of human engagements and their effects on society, psychology, pets and wildlife, environment, and so on. Such engagements are often but not always gender specific. We introduce concepts such as: combat masculinities, women and/in war, heroines and heroes, victimhood, civilian life, war memories, postwar life, and representation of war and violence. We draw on legendary military conflicts taking place before the advent of modern weaponry, involving, for example, the Amazons and the samurai, as well as exemplary modern wars. We also consider the meanings of representations of wars and fighters in historical (primary) sources and their modern usage, as well as recent films and anime. We begin the course by considering how to define war and how to understand gender, followed by an inquiry into various themes, with an understanding that all themes are interconnected. A librarian from the Clement Library will walk us through materials from the US civil war, and veterans who served in the military will expand our views and understanding of the US military in the global context through their personal experiences.

HISTORY 240 - The World Since 1492
What is globalization and when did it begin? How did different parts of the world become deeply connected? Why are some places rich and others poor? We will address these questions, and more, in this introductory survey of the modern world from c. 1450 to the present. This course is an introductory survey of the modern world from c. 1450 to the present. The course will focus on the development of what has been called the ‘modern world system.’ The modern world-system developed with the advent of capitalism and brought in its wake significant changes for different regions of the world. The manner in which different regions were integrated into this new world-system had far-reaching consequences for their internal development and for their relations with the rest of the world. Our aim will be to examine the process by which the modern world-system integrated different regions during the historical stages of its development. We will examine the development of the modern world-system through the following stages: -the first stage of merchant capitalism, c. 1450 -c1750 -the second stage of industrial capitalism, c. 1750 -c. 1870 -the third stage of monopoly capitalism, c 1870 -c.1914 -the fourth stage of defensive monopoly capitalism, 1914 -1945 -the fifth stage of reformed capitalism, 1945 -c. 1989 -the sixth stage of global capitalism, c. 1989 –2008 -the seventh stage of late or crisis capitalism, c 2008-to the present With each stage, we will identify the defining characteristics of capitalism at that stage, and explore its implications for the internal and external development of different regions of the world.

HISTORY 251 - The Chinese Renaissance:  Cultural Transformations in Eleventh-Century China
During the Song dynasty (960-1279), China had the largest cities in the world, with bustling night markets, antique shops, restaurants, and theaters. It was the time when the mariner’s compass, gunpowder weapons, and printing with movable type were invented. Increasing settlement of the well-watered regions south of the Yangzi River allowed an expansion of agricultural production, especially rice, which generated in turn an intensive trade in staple foods on roads and waterways across the empire. The imperial court recruited officials through a tiered system of examinations, creating thereby not only a body of dependable servants, but also a learned, gifted elite with a shared, sophisticated culture. The interrelated developments in economy, technology, social relations, philosophy, religion, literature, and painting during this period bear a close resemblance to those of the Italian Renaissance, yet the achievements of the Song Empire are much less well known than those of Florence, Rome, or Venice.

# COURSE
HISTORY 280 - The Civil War Era in U.S. History
This course explores the era of the American Civil War as a revolutionary one in American History. We begin begin by exploring causes that impelled southern states to leave the Union (1846-1861), we continue by examining the war years (1861-1865), and conclude by focusing on the era of Reconstruction (1860-1880). In particular, we will marinate on the problematic nature of freedom itself. How did Southern secessionists, enslaved persons, abolitionists both Black and white, and hardcore Unionists all claim to be fighting to uphold the ideals of freedom? How did people all claiming to uphold the banner of freedom end up slaughtering over 750,000 of their fellow citizens in the space of four years?

# COURSE
HISTORY 291 - A World History of Happiness: Care of the Self from the Greeks to the Sufis
This exciting new course treats the history of discourses about happiness, focusing especially on four historical episodes. They are ancient Greek philosophy, contemporary positive psychology, Buddhism (and its interpretation in the light of positive psychology), and Sufism. The course seeks to understand what a range of human beings in history have thought happiness consists in, and how they sought to achieve it, and will to put these understandings in dialogue with contemporary positive psychology. The course considers not only virtue and positive emotions (affect) but also ethical action and practices of meditation and mindfulness.

# COURSE
HISTORY 300 - Human Wrongs and Human Rights: History and Practice of Human Rights
This course will introduce the history and practice of human rights. The goal is to provide students with the historical and theoretical background that underlies contemporary humanitarian and human rights practices and debates. Drawing on various interdisciplinary scholarship, the course will ask questions that attempt to improve our historical understanding of the paradoxes and perplexities of Human Rights. The general questions that this course will answer are:

# COURSE
HISTORY 308 - The Earliest Christians
In this course we will consider the beginnings of Christianity from a historical perspective. Students will read ancient texts in translation, consider ancient art and architecture, and at the same time become familiar with modern scholarly approaches to the history of this tradition. We will consider the difficulties of reconstructing ancient events, lives, and movements; students will learn about the most current issues in the field of early Christian studies. In two lectures and a section, we will think together about the challenges of doing ancient history and of doing the history of an ancient religion. Work for the course will include short papers, discussion in sections, some group work, and short essay-style exams.

HISTORY 321 - Culture and Politics in Britain Since 1945
This course will examine Britain's history after World War II, with particular attention to finding ways to understanding recent events including the changing constitutional situation, the "Brexit" referendum, and contemporary party politics and culture. We will look at a long history which includes the Cold War, the 1960s, the Conservative resurgence of the late 1970s and the era of Thatcherism as well as the Blair/Brown years into more recent history. In the present time of rapid change and indeed crisis, we will try to build a deeper understanding of how we got here.

# COURSE
HISTORY 326 - Modern Italy: 1815 to Present
This course examines the history of Italy from 1815 to the present. Modern Italy has been a laboratory for the social and political change of western Europe. Nationalism, fascism, and social democracy have found in Italy an ideal terrain for their conceptual and historical development. We will focus on the process of national unification, on the strategies implemented by the post-unification governments to forge a national identity, on the politics of fascism, and on the contradictory nature of the Italian democracy in the post-W.W.II decades. A variety of media (historical texts, works of fiction, and films) will provide an introduction to the complex and often dramatic history of the Italian people. Moreover, an interdisciplinary perspective will allow us to go beyond the level of state policies to explore the profound transformation of Italian society and culture over the last two centuries.

# COURSE
HISTORY 328 - Humanities Topics in History
Through the lenses of film and literature, this humanities course will focus on the period from the colonial era to the Civil War. Over the semester we will examine the ways that race, racism, slavery, and discrimination have been shaped by the law. Students will write short essays, watch films, read a range of texts, and discuss in class the nexus between social justice and discrimination, and the roles that law has played in expanding or restricting freedom.

# COURSE
HISTORY 329 - Social Science Topics in History
Sir Walter Raleigh wrote in the early 17th century “the ordinary theme and argument of history is war.”  The study of war is fundamentally the study of how societies and cultures develop and employ military forces.  Beginning in the 1950s, military historians began a debate on the “Revolution in Military Affairs” which argued about the nature of the relationship between military and societal transformation.  This course picks up this analysis to examine examples of interdependent societal and military change in the modern and early modern period covering the following four areas: 1) introduction of new technology; 2) professional military education and strategic analysis; 3) shifts in organizational behavior in the face of defeat; and 4) civil-military relations.

# COURSE
HISTORY 339 - Heroes and Superheroes in U.S. Popular Culture
Marvel's cinematic universe has made their stable of superheroes one the most popular and profitable intellectual properties in the twenty first century. Yet, this represents just the latest in a cyclical pattern of public fascination with fictional individuals possessed with extraordinary abilities. In this history course, we will explore the changing dynamics in U.S. popular culture that defined fictional heroes from 1840 to the present. During those years the nation became an international and economic powerhouse, altering the ways in which Americans understood their place in the larger world. That coincided with a new consumer culture and domestic ideals that played out in novels, comic books, films, and television. Popular culture in the United States often used heroic (and superheroic) figures, initially almost always presented as white cis-gender men, as stand-ins for U.S. ambitions; to rationalize the gender and racial status quo; and to encourage audience emulation. Challenges to these characters came almost immediately as activists demanded broader depictions, representation in public life, and a redefinition of the dominant gender and racial hierarchies. This class will select a number of hero case studies from westerns, dramas, superhero comics, films, and television shows to explore specific issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality as they relate to changing notions of U.S. nationalism. These will include Natty Bumppo, Nancy Drew, Zorro, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Spiderman, Lara Croft, Blackpanther, Ms. Marvel, and many others.

# COURSE
HISTORY 346 - History of American Radicalism
This course introduces students to the history of activism in the United States and it focuses particular attention on the social and political movements of the1960s and 1970s. Students will be asked to analyze the origins, strengths, weaknesses, and impact of various movements and the important connections between them. Among these will be the LGBTQ movement, the Welfare Rights Movement, the Labor Movement, the Prisoner Rights Movement, the Chicano/a Rights Movement, the Asian-American Rights Movement, the Women’s Movement, and many more. Students will draw from books, memoirs and primary documents, as well as will view numerous documentaries so that they not only have a good handle on what motivated various social and political movements in history and what their impacts might have been, but also how those movements might inform activist struggles today.

# COURSE
HISTORY 356 - Histories of Race and Law
The United States is a deeply unequal society divided and segregated along lines of race despite supposed guarantees to legal equality and appeals to colorblindness. This course will take a critical look at this tension in American history and consider the active role of law in constructing and maintaining racial categories, inequality, and segregation in the late nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States. We will examine major developments in the relationship between race and law since the end of the Civil War, including the construction of the Jim Crow socio-legal regime, racialization of criminality, US colonialism and imperial expansion, immigration restriction and control, and the criminalization of social movements and other forms of protest. We will use three critical theoretical frameworks to understand these developments: Critical Race Theory, settler colonialism, and critical archival studies. We will also consider the roles of race and law in shaping various other axes of power over time, including gender, labor, citizenship, and empire. Course materials will include academic scholarship, legal analysis, and primary archival documents. The final project provides students the opportunity to work with archival materials at the Clements Library to create an exhibition proposal that demonstrates how those archival materials relate to the themes of our course.

# COURSE
HISTORY 388 - Black Feminist Thought and Practice
What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.

HISTORY 390 - Topics Mini-Course
Is it possible to have a “secular” world? What is the relationship between religion and revolution? How can religious traditions relate to each other, in a constructive and creative fashion, without descending into violence, at a time when they are obliged to come into closer and more intimate relations with each other than ever before? Is religion on the way out, or is it on the way in? What contributes to the phenomenal rise in fundamentalist commitment in so many places?

# COURSE
HISTORY 396 - Germany and the Black Diaspora
Germany is a country not often associated with the African diaspora, but what students in this class will learn, is that people of African descent have long been a part of Central European history. From Black saint iconography in medieval churches to entertainers such as Josephine Baker or Beyoncé in Berlin, Germans have long engaged with, and responded to, Black figures in European history. In so doing, they have participated in global conversations on nationalism, colonialism, race, and gender. In this class we will examine Germany’s Black pasts in general, and Afro-German history specifically, all with an eye toward interrogating the creation and interpretations of Black collective identities. In so doing, we will analyze the pitfalls and advantages of adopting U.S. theoretical paradigms to engage with issues of Black communities beyond U.S. borders, as well as broaden our understanding of the cultural and historical diversities among Germany’s Black population.

# COURSE
HISTORY 417 - Twentieth-Century German and European Thought

HISTORY 434 - Russia/USSR in the 20th and 21st Centuries: War, Revolution, and Reform
In 1917, the Bolshevik party took power and established what they claimed was the first socialist government in history This course explores how individuals experienced the immense political and changes that followed, as the new state transformed the economy, developed a distinct form of government, and attempted to create the new Soviet man and woman. We will pay particular attention to conflicting interpretations of Soviet history and will seek to understand how the past has shaped the present.

# COURSE
HISTORY 447 - The Icelandic Sagas: Vikings, Women, and Vengeance
The Icelandic Sagas are unique literary documents from medieval Iceland. They inform us about the cultural, political, and religious currents of land in tumult and transition. Unlike many contemporary texts, these are not inherently moralistic or celebratory — instead they are dark, matter-of-fact inquiries into the way individuals respond to often unresolvable situations. In this course, we will encounter vindictive women, treacherous kings, heroes and anti-heroes, lawyers, berserkers, and poets.

# COURSE
HISTORY 450 - Japan to 1700:  Origin Myth to Shogun Dynasty
This course covers the complex and intriguing history of the Japanese archipelago from about 300 BCE to 1700 CE. You might have wondered how the Sun Goddess became the ancestral deity of today’s tenno (imperial family); if the samurai really flaunted bushido and committed seppuku; or if today’s manga dates back in style to a 12th century scroll of wrestling animals; and, finally, if there is any truth to Ghost of Tsushima. We consider these and other questions by examining patterns of transformation along the twin axes of time and theme.

# COURSE
HISTORY 472 - Topics in Asian History
This course will examine some of the most canonical and cutting-edge literature about and coming out of Southeast Asia and its diaspora over the last two centuries as it reflects and reimagines the complex history of the region. Although the region is rich in literary traditions our focus will be the modern novel. Working in loose chronological order and across different colonial and national contexts, we will read novels that explore and serve as commentary on themes such as race and politics, gender and intimacy, modernity and technology, war and its aftermath. We will read each novel as a window into its historical milieu and consider its influences. All readings will be in English translation. Methods of evaluation include regular responses (both creative and written), participation (both in Canvas and in class) and a final project.

# COURSE
HISTORY 481 - Topics in European History
The course focuses on interfaces of Soviet visual arts and political propaganda that characterized the years of Revolution, the NEP Period, and Stalinism in the USSR, i.e., the years between the revolutions of 1917 and Stalin’s death in 1953. Among other things, we will study modern print media, ranging from poster art to publishing projects such as the propaganda magazine USSR in Construction, but also phenomena which, although displaying distinct visual aspects, have largely been neglected, e.g., such as picture postcards, wall newspapers, and the like. Another major topic are visual aspects of public festivities and, overall, visual aspects of the public space. We will also discuss profiles of artists who were active in forging the bridge between the avant-garde and political art (Klucis, Lissitski, Rodchenko). Time permitting, some of these domains will be compared— and contrasted— with similar phenomena in interwar Germany, especially as regards the culture of photo-illustrated magazines, visual aspects of the public space, or the cult of personality. Western contributions to Soviet visual culture will also be discussed. Students unfamiliar with Russian history will be encouraged to look for phenomena of visual propaganda in other national cultures, including the present times; knowledge of Russian is not required.

# COURSE
HISTORY 497 - History Colloquium
Houses and homes are among of the most important material settings of family and social life. Houses are physical structures and congealed capital, but as homes they can also be touchstones to cultural identity, and symbolic of dwellers' gender, rank, and status. They have been described as shelters that uphold patriarchy and temples to conjugal sexuality. They have also been conceived as safe spaces to nurture or conceal a range of non-normative and experimental lifestyles. This course asks what can houses can tell us about their broader societies and the fascinating way they often register change over time. Our canvas will embrace everything from McMansions to informal squatter housing, country estates to tenements.

HONORS 230 - Honors Core in Social Science
Worried about saturated fat, animal cruelty, or climate change? Confused about the messaging you are getting from the news media, Instagram influencers, and peers? Ever wondered why people argue that the Western or American diet is inferior to the Asian or even Mediterranean diet? Then this is the course for you! This class takes a hard look at many of the stereotypes about the "Western" diet, which nutritionists and influencers love to demonize, and the classic studies that underlie them. Along the way, we will also have an opportunity to taste the foods that nutritional activists prescribe — and see if we can come up with delicious plant based alternatives to foods like hamburgers.

# COURSE
HONORS 241 - Honors Core Writing in Humanities
Our relationship with animals is far more complex, pervasive, and paradoxical than we may realize. Consider the many animals that serve as school mascots, or the animals served as school lunch, or the animals dissected in school classrooms. Or shift your attention to the plethora of cat videos on YouTube or the simple existence of doggles (eyewear for dogs?!). Or, if you’re still not convinced that our relationship with animals is both multifaceted and omnipresent, consider the environmental damage caused by factory farming, the relentless anthropomorphism that Disney movies provide, or the profound impact of owning pets on human health.

# COURSE
INTLSTD 308 - Conflict and Comics: Reframing the Middle East
In recent decades, comics have evolved into a powerful medium for telling stories about conflicts in the Middle East, whether through autobiographical narratives or journalistic reports. The accessibility of comics as a kind of global language enables artists to convey the heavy toll that political strife, revolution, and war take on soldiers and civilians. This course considers the development of comics reportage and memoirs through the famous examples of Joe Sacco’s Palestine (1993-1995) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2000-2001). We then explore comics concerning civil and interstate wars in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, comparing works illustrated from the perspective of Western travelers with those written by natives to the Middle East or children of refugees. We also contrast printed formats with online comics, such as the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Welcome to the New World,” asking ourselves how digital platforms have reshaped comics and our reading experience.

# COURSE
INTLSTD 352 - Global Workers' Rights
Why are so many of our t-shirts and iPhones manufactured around the world under conditions that seem to violate basic human rights? Why do migrant workers in the U.S. often labor under unsafe and exploitative conditions? Can corporate codes of conduct and sweatshop-free branding reverse this global unraveling of labor protections? What legal instruments and strategies can be used to expand rights for workers across globalized supply chains, and how can workers access these rights? What is the role of worker centers, trade unions, and other civil society organizations, as well as actors inside the state, in realizing global standards for rights at work?

# COURSE
ISLAM 378 - Muslim and Arab Literatures
Long a major component of Arab American and Arab Anglophone literature, Palestinian writing in English is increasingly evolving into a singular literary body. Engaged with questions particular to Palestine and the struggle for a Palestinian future, Palestinian writing has been spreading beyond its geographic and linguistic origins and gaining readers around the world, especially Western metropolitan audiences. Such a shift was necessary as the fate of Palestine and sometimes the survival of the Palestinian people in their homeland have been questions whose answers lay almost squarely in the power centers of the Anglophone world. Yet, while it has become a worlding literature actively bringing its concerns and artistic inventions to global spheres of influence, Palestinian literature, in English and translation, must by necessity remain rooted to its homeland even while it negotiates the tribulations of  diaspora or shatat (the Arabic world for scattering). Attempting to document nearly eight decades of anti-colonial struggle, massacres, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and anticolonial resistance, Palestinian literature has also had to struggle with issues of individual freedom as well as racism, and gender and class equality. Given these circumstances, Palestinian writing is steeped in layered critiques from anti-imperialist and postcolonial discourses, to feminist criticism, to the fine points of esthetic and poetic theory, which have made it a rich, multi-faceted, and absorbing body of literature worth examining in depth.

ITALIAN 312 - Genius and Geography
An enormous body of visual culture surrounding the plague has developed since the disease’s first appearance in Western Europe during the so-called Black Death of 1348–53. From painted altarpieces, to protective talismans, to entire churches commemorating epidemics of plague, Italy during the Early Modern period became the epicenter for artworks depicting the disease.

# COURSE
ITALIAN 317 - The Renaissance
During the Italian Renaissance, many artists, writers, and thinkers saw themselves as cultural heirs to ancient Rome and Greece. While valid, this characterization leaves out the Renaissance fascination—and perhaps obsession—with a larger span of antiquity and with contemporary "others." From inventing their own interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphs and stealing obelisks, to recreating the Holy Land as a premodern tourist attraction in northern Italy, the Italian Renaissance defined itself through an embroidery of invented histories and imagined worlds.

# COURSE
ITALIAN 415 - Topics in Italian Studies
Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet has sold more than 10 million copies in 40 countries. Some have called it a Harry Potter saga for adults. But Ferrante does not build a fantastic universe of wizards, patronuses, and magical trains. On the contrary, the quartet’s portrayal of female friendship, motherhood, and family unfolds against the backdrop of a very distinct and underexplored Italian past. And yet despite being rooted in the particularities of Italian urban life, Ferrante’s saga has become a global phenomenon. What makes it so appealing to audiences all over the world? In this class we will read all four of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and discuss its peculiar place (and the place of Italy more broadly) in World Literature. We will pay special attention to how the Neapolitan novels challenge notions of authorship, especially with regards to female authorship, and shine a light on the crucial role of translation in the global circulation of literature.

JUDAIC 258 - The Bible as Literature
To study the Bible “as literature” means that we will approach these writings the same way we approach any work of literature: we explore characters, genre, narrative development, styles of narration, point of view, etc… Students will gain new tools for interpreting stories that may be very familiar, including the loss of Eden, the binding of Isaac, the Exodus from Egypt, and the battle of David and Goliath. We will also do close readings of passages from texts including Psalms, Proverbs, the Book of Job, and Ecclesiastes. We will consider some of the ways Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and secular readers have interpreted and made use of the Bible. In addition to analyzing texts in the Biblical canon we will explore some of the echoes of these texts in subsequent works of art, literature, film, and music.

JUDAIC 318 - Humanities Topics in Judaism
This seminar will introduce students to historical approaches to culture and identity using the extraordinary example of the Jewish experience in the cities of the multinational Austria-Hungarian Empire. Cities such as Vienna, Prague, and Budapest were sites of explosive creativity in modern literature and the arts, political movements, and the new science of psychoanalysis. The contrasts, conflicts, and synergies between traditional Judaism and modern Western assimilation were dramatic in this realm extending into portions of today’s Poland, Ukraine, Romania, and Balkan region. This course will explore the rich history of Jewish life in these cities through the work of writers including Franz Kafka, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and others, along with several films. How was the position between East and West—and between tradition and future—linked to this creativity? Students will be graded on the basis of class discussions and several short essays. There is also an opportunity to continue the class in May, 2025 on a three-week trip to the cities of Prague and Vienna for two additional credits through the Global Course Connections program. This study abroad opportunity is not required for participants in the winter term GER303.02/HIS328.02, JUD318.03 class, and will not entail additional Spring term tuition costs, but there will be an additional program fee, and flight to Europe and some other expenses are not included.

# COURSE
JUDAIC 322 - The Origins of Nazism
Where did the Nazis come from? Was the Weimar Republic bound to fail? Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of Anti-Semitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of the “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population and cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements. These ideas and practices didn’t originate with the Nazis and they didn’t operate in a geopolitical vacuum. Thinking about Nazi racism and genocide in both its particular specifics and in a larger global historical context is the main goal of this course.

# COURSE
JUDAIC 342 - Jerusalem: One City Three Faiths
Jerusalem is a city holy to the three monotheistic communities who believe it to be sacred, albeit for different reasons. While in some ways the common sacrality invested in Jerusalem by the three major monotheistic religions brings them together—doctrinally and practically—historically speaking it has sparked tension and even violence in some cases. This course will explore the history of Jerusalem as a lens through which to reflect on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as the ways in which these three religions have interacted with one another from the Bronze Ages through the Middle Ages to the twenty first century. Our intellectual journey to Jerusalem begins before Jews had built a temple in the city and traces the Hellenic and Roman history of the city. Then we discuss the emergence of Christianity and the relationship of various Christian sects to Jerusalem, as well as the political status of the city during the late Roman and Byzantine periods. After that we address the rise of Islam and the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem with particular attention to the ways in which the city’s importance to Muslims refracts the broader relationship between Islam and both Judaism and Christianity. In tracing the history of the city up through the present day, we cover the Crusades, the Ottoman Empire, the emergence of Zionism, and the Israeli-Palestinian encounters. Throughout, we focus on questions of ritual, symbolism, messianism, the built environment, empire, law, and memory.

# COURSE
JUDAIC 351 - Anne Frank in Context
This decolonial Dutch Studies course examines the Holocaust and World War II in The Netherlands and beyond through the careful analysis of the Diary of Anne Frank and its legacy. With a special emphasis on increasing your understanding of antisemitism and European colonial racism, the course takes the Diary, its film, stage and television adaptations, and other Holocaust accounts as the basis for critical discussions. Topics include Jewish migration and Jewish life in Amsterdam, bystanding, resistance and rescue, witnessing, Holocaust denial, and controversial issues such as the fictionalization of Anne Frank and alleged Holocaust exploitation. Dutch colonial thought is at the center of the course’s examinations. You will develop your daily discussion writings/recordings (DWs) into a midterm paper and draw from them for your culminating mini-essays exam at the end of the term. Although the course adopts various textual examples from Dutch (including the Diary), all literature is read in English and the course is conducted in English.

# COURSE
JUDAIC 388 - Antisemitism and Philosemitism: Jews in Myth and Thought
The nature of “the Jew” has occupied some of the most influential minds of the last two centuries. Some have lauded them as God's Chosen People, Hollywood moguls, Nobel laureates, intellectual geniuses, and highly accomplished professionals. At the same time “the Jews” have been feared and despised as imagined worshippers of the Anti-Christ, political conspirators, financial manipulators, child murderers, and threats to racial purity. We will survey the development of stereotypes, myths, and patterns of prejudice about Jews. Through primary sources and commentaries, the course will examine the ‘building blocks’ of Nazi racial antisemitism in the religion, politics, and cultures of the West, focusing on the way in which “the Jew” is imagined and represented in Christian theology, Western literature, and modern philosophy. We will also consider the intersections of anti-Black racism, critical and decolonial theories, and investigate the contemporary politics of antisemitism—its definitions, its relationships to anti-Zionism and the ‘philosemitism’ of the Christian Right.

# COURSE
JUDAIC 417 - Topics in Judaic Studies
This seminar is devoted to unpacking and critically exploring the extraordinary life and work of Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972), surely one of the most significant Jewish theologians and religious figures of the last century. Thinker and mystic; scholar of Rabbinics and Jewish mysticism; Yiddish-language poet, ethicist and social justice activist, Heschel bridged the worlds of East European Hasidism, Weimar culture, and 1960’s political engagement. In this seminar, we will interweave biography and cultural history, with a close reading of his central theological, devotional and topical works (ranging from God in Search of Man; The Sabbath; to Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity). In the closing weeks we will pay special attention to Heschelian themes that are of special interest to the class. We will probe the impact of the (near) destruction of European Jewry and of the Civil Rights Movement on his thought and commitments; and Heschel’s posthumous role as “prophet of social justice” “rebbe” and religious icon, which is sometimes at odds with his controversial nature while alive.

LACS 446 - Comparative Linguistics
This course is directed to students interested in exploring variation across the structure of language. Human languages have strikingly similar structural features, but at the same time they also vary insignificant respects. Substantial advances in our understanding of human language have resulted from the individual and comparative analysis of distinct languages. Their similarities and differences can be explored from cognitive, formal, theoretical and typological perspectives. In this course, this comparative approach is explored in the context of generative linguistics, under the hypothesis that a species-specific cognitive capacity (a faculty of language) determines both the common properties and the boundaries of variation across languages. Some of the questions that arise in this context are: what structural principles are common across different human languages? What kind of variation can we find across human languages? How can this variation be analyzed and understood? What gives rise to this sort of cross-linguistic variation over time? The course is also relevant for students interested in the study of different languages.

LATINOAM 311 - Latina/o Studies and the Humanities
Stories of undocumented immigrants are often couched in terms of silence and invisibility, using expressions like “living in the shadows” and “under the radar.” Many Immigrant rights activists, on the other hand, resist this silence and invisibility and see storytelling as a political act that makes the humanity of the undocumented impossible to ignore. This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”

LATINOAM 404 - Latinas/os in the U. S.: Social Problems and Social Issues
Latinas/os are now the largest minority group in the U. S. -- around 18 % of the population. While the media and census data tend to depict them as homogeneous "Hispanics," they are really a very heterogeneous group. In this course, we consider some of the major groups: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central Americans, Venezuelans, and Colombians. We examine their contrasting social characteristics (social class of origin, race/ethnicity, gender, legal status) that are the result of their different reasons for migration; different processes of incorporation; and different social outcomes in the U. S. We particularly look at the various histories that led them to come to the U.S., the impact the legal system had on their processes of incorporation (as undocumented migrants vs. refugees vs. professional migrants), and the opportunities available to them in various regions of the country during the historical moment when they arrived in the U.S.

# COURSE
LING 102 - First Year Seminar (Humanities)
This course offers an overview of the sounds (consonants and vowels) of the languages of the world. We shall start with the sound system of English, and then compare its properties with those in other languages. We shall discuss both the linguistic and social implications of speech sounds. For example, how do we annotate and analyze the sound system of a language? How do dialects differ from each other? Are people biased against certain accents? Are some accents or pronunciations more attractive than others?   Through exploring these questions, we aim to gain a better understanding of the sound systems of the world’s languages, how linguists do research, how to gather and interpret linguistic data, language attitudes, and the social implications of language variation. Students also have opportunities to explore their own interests, exercise creativity, foster critical thinking, and develop problem-solving skills.

LING 103 - First Year Seminar (Social Science)
The device on which you are reading this is causing language to change more rapidly than scholars can keep up with.

LING 193 - Social Sciences Topics in Linguistics
In this course, we'll examine the processes by which young children acquire their vocabularies, beginning with a single first word and (by the age of 7-8) expanding into the tens of thousands. As adults, we usually learn new words by reference to words we already know, whether by considering the context in which they appear, or by looking them up in a dictionary. However, young children don't have this luxury! In this class, we'll consider biological and social components of word learning, including whether other animal species have words in their communication systems, how children connect sounds to concepts, why children sometimes overextend word meanings (such as referring to any animal with four legs as a doggie), the debate about whether children are born with some knowledge about how words work or learn everything from scratch, what causes the “word explosion” many children go through between 18-24 months, how children learn to use words in sentences, how they continue to develop their vocabularies in the early school years, how bilingual children assemble multiple vocabularies simultaneously, and most importantly, how linguists and psychologists go about studying these phenomena, including both experimental methods and observational studies.

# COURSE
LING 210 - Introduction to Linguistic Analysis
Languages are rule-governed systems. The rules that interest linguists are not prescriptive ones of the type "don't split infinitives" but are rather the systematic patterns that language speakers unconsciously know as part of their linguistic competence. For example, as a speaker of English you know how to order words in a sentence to convey a particular meaning and how to change that meaning with seemingly subtle changes in pitch; you can appropriately modify your speech for different social situations, and can understand and create novel sentences you've never heard before.

# COURSE
LING 302 - Humanities Topics in Linguistics
African American Language, the language variety spoken by many, but not all, and not exclusively, African Americans in the US is the cornerstone of many parts of the U.S. Black experience. We see it in day to day use in things we sometimes think of as “Gen Z” slang, in comedy, in writing, in music, and in television and film. It’s often considered “bad” or “slang” by people who like to peeve about language, but it persists as a vibrant part of Black culture nevertheless. Why?

# COURSE
LING 313 - Sound Patterns
This course explores two fundamental aspects of the sounds of human languages: speech sounds as physical entities (phonetics) and as part of a linguistic system (phonology). In viewing sounds as physical elements, the focus is on articulatory and acoustic descriptions: How are speech sounds made? What types of articulatory movements and configurations are used in the world's languages? What are the acoustic properties of consonants and vowels? In this part of the course, the goal is to learn to understand, describe, and transcribe many of the sounds known to occur in human languages. In addition, we shall learn to measure and analyze acoustic properties of consonants and vowels and to examine how they vary in context.

# COURSE
LING 316 - Aspects of Meaning
What do you know when you know the meaning of a word, a phrase, or a sentence? This introductory course aims to answer this question through the study of truth-conditional semantics and (to a lesser extent) pragmatics. The course will take a compositional approach to the representation of linguistic meaning, by investigating the ways that humans are able to understand the meaning of novel phrases and sentences based on the meanings of their parts (words and morphemes) and the ways in which they combine (morphology and syntax).

# COURSE
LING 336 - Reading: Language, the Brain, and Cognition
In this course we explore the neurological dimensions of language and reading. We begin by investigating the brain regions associated with reading, and examine the anatomical pathways through which visual information is transmitted and processed. Moreover, we examine the impact of word appearance, alphabet structure, font styles, and sizes on influence visual language processing.

# COURSE
LING 347 - Talking Minds
This course introduces students to the cognitive processes involved in language and conversation. We will discuss aspects of human language comprehension, production, and development, across different domains of linguistic representation and language modalities. Students will learn what is known (and what is still unknown) about how language is processed, and about the methods that are used to address these questions.

# COURSE
LING 370 - Language and Discrimination: Language as Social Statement
Who speaks “correctly”? Which languages are taught in schools? Who gets to be bilingual? In this course, we explore how language is used to construct and suppress identity, with a particular focus on the languages and cultures of what is now the United States. As we investigate the relationship between language and power across time and space, we will also make connections with our own life experiences and with current events. Topics covered include the intersections of race and ethnicity with migration, language policy, pseudoscience, media representation, and multilingualism.   This course fulfills the Race & Ethnicity requirement. As such, we focus on linguistic discrimination which is rooted in discrimination based on race and ethnicity. We demonstrate how language has been used to reinforce essentialized views of race, and how discrimination based on language can often be a proxy for discrimination based on race and ethnicity. We discuss how language has been a site of oppression at both the level of the individual and society, and make explicit the connections between individual-level processes and social structures, showing how interpersonal bigotry both reinforces and is reinforced by laws, policies, and other norms. This course is designed to help students make sense of the world that they are in by giving context for how we got here, while also encouraging us to imagine and co-create a better present and future.

LING 432 - Introduction to Neurolinguistics
This course introduces the neural machinery behind our ability to use language. We discuss the brain bases of perceiving speech, sign, and text, lexical processing, syntax, and semantics. We draw on a range of state-of-the-art tools and techniques from cognitive neuroscience including the study of neurological and developmental language disorders. Special attention is given to how linguistic theories can inform, and be informed by, our understanding of the brain.

# COURSE
LING 441 - Introduction to Computational Linguistics
This course provides a hands-on introduction to the field of computational linguistics -- a field which, as it is viewed in this course, involves the intersection of linguistics with computer science. We look not only at some ways in which the kinds of problems that linguists investigate can be informed by computational methods but also at how some of the tasks of natural language processing can be informed by linguistic theory, where these two areas of investigation inevitably overlap.

# COURSE
LING 446 - Comparative Linguistics
This course is directed to students interested in exploring variation across the structure of language. Human languages have strikingly similar structural features, but at the same time they also vary insignificant respects. Substantial advances in our understanding of human language have resulted from the individual and comparative analysis of distinct languages. Their similarities and differences can be explored from cognitive, formal, theoretical and typological perspectives.

LING 497 - Capstone Seminar
In this course, we’ll examine the processes by which children acquire their first language(s), beginning with the coos of infants and ending with the explosion in vocabulary development in the early school years. Language is an extraordinarily complex system, one which language scientists still do not completely understand – so how is it that children are already well on their way to mastering it before they can even tie their shoes? Perhaps more than any other facet of human development, language acquisition has been central to the centuries-old debate about whether the contents of our minds come solely from our experiences with the world, or whether our mental characteristics and abilities are (at least partially) innate. As we consider this question, we will also engage with a paradox that is central in the study of language: individual languages seem to be wildly different from one another, yet normally-developing children effortlessly acquire whatever language they’re exposed to at an amazing speed, with or without parental input or explicit instruction.

# COURSE
LING 516 - Semantics and Pragmatics
At root, language is a mapping from sound or sign to meaning. So what is meaning? One might approach that question in many ways, but in this class we approach it as a scientific question, by constructing a mathematical model of what might be going on behind the scenes to produce that which we can observe. Now it is much harder to observe meaning than it is to observe speech sounds or signs, but not impossible. Our main sources of information are human judgments about (among other things) what sorts of scenarios make a sentence true or not, and which sentences entail or contradict other sentences.

LSWA 228 - What is Writing?
In Storytelling for Social Justice, Lee Anne Bell writes, “The diverse groups that make up the United States provide a rich source of stories to draw upon, but in a deeply racialized society stained by structural racism, not all stories are equally acknowledged, valued, or affirmed…Some stories are supported by the power structure, while others must fight tenaciously to be heard.” Bell's words imply two meanings of “telling stories”: by telling and being open to many different stories we can expand our understanding of what it means to live in this country; but also, stories themselves “tell” or reveal a deeper understanding of how power shapes narratives around race. In this course on writing and rhetoric you will examine an array of stories that shed light on race and ethnicity, applying a set of critical perspectives to look beyond the surface of the stories apparent in all sorts of texts, including film, podcasts, speeches, fiction, historical documents, photographs, art, and performance. Writing for this class includes a personal journal in which you track your responses and the development of your ideas, an end of semester reflection, and three papers examining the ways different stories “tell” us something about which “stories are supported,” and why and how others “must fight tenaciously to be heard.”

The courses focuses on the study of important classes of functions: namely, linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, power, and rational functions. Along the way we study different ways we can represent functions as well as how to describe and understand their key properties. Assessments in Math 105 typically include individual homework, team homework, mastery assessments, and traditional exams. Students watch short lectures videos before class so that classtime itself can be used for groupwork, immediate feedback, and hands-on problem-solving. Calculators are leveraged as an important tool for building understanding and comfort with the material; a scientific calculator is required for assessments and the Demos app is used frequently in class and on homework. Students who successfully complete 105 are fully prepared for Math 115.   For more information on this course, please visit the Department of Mathematics webpage   MATH 105/115/116 Waitlist Policy:  Enrollment is handled slightly differently for Math 105, 115, and 116.

Much of the motivation for this approach comes from applications. Examples of applications of differential equations to science and engineering are a significant part of the course. There are relatively few proofs.

# COURSE
MATH 412 - Introduction to Modern Algebra
This course is designed to serve as an introduction to the methods and concepts of abstract mathematics. A typical student entering this course has substantial experience in using complex mathematical (calculus) calculations to solve physical or geometrical problems but is inexperienced at analyzing carefully the content of definitions and the logical flow of ideas which underlie and justify these calculations. Although the topics discussed here are quite distinct from those of calculus, an important goal of the course is to introduce the student to this type of analysis. Much of the reading, homework exercises, and exams consist of theorems (propositions, lemmas, etc.) and their proofs. Math 217, or equivalent, required as background.   For more information on this course, please visit the Department of Mathematics webpage

# COURSE
MATH 417 - Matrix Algebra I
Many problems in science, engineering, and mathematics are best formulated in terms of matrices - rectangular arrays of numbers. This course is an introduction to the properties of and operations on matrices with a wide variety of applications. The main emphasis is on concepts and problem-solving, but students are responsible for some of the underlying theory. Diversity rather than depth of applications is stressed. This course is not intended for mathematics majors, who should elect Math 217, and/or Math 493-494 if pursuing the honors major.

Undergrads are assigned to teams which work through one research problem through the semester.

# COURSE
MATH 451 - Advanced Calculus I
This course has two complementary goals: (1) a rigorous development of the fundamental ideas of calculus, and (2) a further development of the student’s ability to deal with abstract mathematics and mathematical proofs. The keywords here are “rigor” and “proof;” almost all of the material of the course is geared toward understanding and constructing definitions, theorems (propositions, lemmas, etc.), and proofs. This is considered one of the more difficult among the undergraduate mathematics courses, and students should be prepared to make a strong commitment to the course. In particular, it is strongly recommended that some course which requires proofs (such as Math 412) be taken before Math 451.

# COURSE
MATH 452 - Advanced Calculus II
This course gives a rigorous development of multivariable calculus and elementary function theory with some view towards generalizations. Concepts and proofs are stressed. This is a relatively difficult course, but the stated prerequisites provide adequate preparation.

Additionally, we will examine their quantitative accuracy, stability, and convergence properties. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to implement basic numerical algorithms in MATLAB and prove stability and convergence in simple scenarios. If time permits, we will also explore time integrators for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

# COURSE
MATH 472 - Numerical Methods with Financial Applications
This is a survey of the basic numerical methods which are used to solve scientific problems. The goals of the course are similar to those of Math 471, but the applications are chosen to be of interest to students in the Actuarial Mathematics and Financial Mathematics programs.

# COURSE
MATH 475 - Elementary Number Theory
This is an elementary introduction to number theory, especially congruence arithmetic. Number Theory is one of the few areas of mathematics in which problems easily describable to a layman (is every even number the sum of two primes?) have remained unsolved for centuries. Recently some of these fascinating but seemingly useless questions have come to be of central importance in the design of codes and ciphers. In addition to strictly number- theoretic questions, concrete examples of structures such as rings and fields from abstract algebra are discussed. Concepts and proofs are emphasized, but there is some discussion of algorithms which permit efficient calculation. Students are expected to do simple proofs and may be asked to perform computer experiments. Although there are no special prerequisites and the course is essentially self-contained, most students have some experience in abstract mathematics and problem solving and are interested in learning proofs. At least three semesters of college mathematics are recommended. A Computational Laboratory (Math 476, 1 credit) will usually be offered as an optional supplement to this course.

# COURSE
MATH 476 - Computational Laboratory in Number Theory
Intended as a companion course to Math 475 (Elem. Number Theory) or 575 (Intro to Theory of Numbers) Participation should boost the student’s performance in either of those classes. Students in the Lab will see mathematics as an exploratory science (as mathematicians do).

# COURSE
MATH 494 - Honors Algebra II
Math 493-494 is one of the more abstract and difficult sequences in the undergraduate program. Its goal is to introduce students to the basic structures of modern abstract algebra (groups, rings, fields, and modules) in a rigorous way. Emphasis is on concepts and proofs; calculations are used to illustrate the general theory. Exercises tend to be quite challenging. Students must have some previous exposure to rigorous proof-oriented mathematics and be prepared to work hard.

# COURSE
MATH 498 - Topics in Modern Mathematics
This course will be an introduction to basic Galois theory, taught through problem solving (IBL). Comfort with proof based mathematics is crucial; familiarity with linear algebra will be very helpful. Our main goal is to understand Abel's theorem about the unsolvability of the general quintic equation by radicals, and Galois's more general result describing which polynomials are solvable by radicals. This course will cover significantly less than 494 or 594, and is meant for students who want a slower, more friendly introduction to these topics.

# COURSE
MATH 501 - Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics Student Seminar

Starting with data representation (vectors, matrices, and tensors), the course introduces techniques for dimensionality reduction, including diffusion maps, t-SNE, and basic topological data analysis. I will bring an application-based approach to spectral graph theory, addressing the combinatorial meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their associated graph matrices and extensions to hypergraphs via tensors. Applications of dynamical systems theory, dynamic mode decomposition, and foundation models will also be covered. Real-world examples, particularly from biological data, will ground these methods. Students will write code to implement algorithms for real-world data problems. The course also features several guest lectures from industry and government experts.

# COURSE

If time permits, Lp spaces will also be covered. This course has some overlaps with MATH 597, but this course will proceed at a gentler pace and emphasize measures on Rn instead of general spaces.

# COURSE
MATH 555 - Introduction to Functions of a Complex Variable with Applications
This course is an introduction to the theory of calculus of functions of one complex variable.  Applications of the theory will be stressed at various points throughout the course, but the presentation will be rigorous, and students will be expected not only to perform calculations but also to write proofs. A firm grasp of introductory real analysis is essential. Topics will include but will not be limited to algebra, geometry, and topology of the complex plane; differentiation of functions of a complex variable; the Cauchy–Riemann equations; conformal maps; sequences and series of complex functions, including power series; analytic functions; exponential, trigonometric, and hyperbolic trigonometric functions; fractional linear transformations; contour integrals; Cauchy's theorem and integral formula; harmonic functions; Taylor and Laurent series; residue theory and its applications; and applications to fluid dynamics.

# COURSE
MATH 557 - Applied Asymptotic Analysis
Asymptotic analysis is the quantitative study of approximations. The fundamental idea is that one tries to solve a problem in applied mathematics (say, a boundary-value problem for a partial or ordinary differential equation) by embedding it into a family of problems with a parameter. If the problem can be solved exactly for one special value of the parameter, or in a limiting case, then asymptotic analysis can be used to analyze how the solution changes as the parameter is tuned from the special value to a more physically reasonable one. The course will develop the general theory of so-called asymptotic expansions, which are a kind of series in the perturbation parameter that are extremely useful in practice, in a way that is mathematically completely rigorous, despite the strange fact that they frequently fail to converge at all! We will then study how to use asymptotic expansions to evaluate integrals that cannot be computed in closed form and that are also difficult to approximate numerically. Next, we will turn to differential equations and use asymptotic expansions to evaluate solutions near certain singular points and also to study the way that solutions depend on parameters. At the end of the course we will study how the differential equations of diverse physical phenomena can be reduced, with the help of asymptotic expansions, to certain universal model equations that show up again and again in applied mathematics.

Basic examples of codes we cover include Golay, Hamming, BCH, Reed-Muller, and Reed-Solomon codes. We will further discuss linear codes and cyclic codes and give fundamental asymptotic bounds on coding efficiency.

# COURSE
MATH 572 - Numerical Methods for Differential Equations

MEMS 211 - Later Medieval Europe, 1000-1500
In the year 1000, Europe was barely able to feed its growing population, and riven with the violence of competing warlords. By 1500, Europeans were crossing the Atlantic Ocean, trading directly with China, and powerful king’s ruled large territories unified by law. This course looks at how Europe emerged from the margins of the world’s stage by examining events like the Crusades, the Black Death, and the invention of the printing press, the rise of institutions like monarchies, the papacy, and human bondage, and by looking at long term changes to the medieval climate. We will also ask, who belonged to this emerging world and who was steadily excluded? Where did the idea of nations come from? And we will ask, what is the relationship between the real Middle Ages and the fantasy one that fills video games, white-supremacist politics, and the news media?

MEMS 360 - Special Topics in Medieval and Early Modern Studies
What is the relationship between science and magic in the Middle Ages? How does the popular literature of the time depict that relationship? What can we, as modern readers, learn from these texts? From the 6th century to the early 16th century, the Middle Ages bore and witnessed significant intellectual, philosophical, and scientific advancements. Through rich textual networks, these advancements cascaded across the Middle East, through Italy and France, all the way up to England, and they were often reflected in the popular and imaginative literatures of the time. This course will provide a survey of that literature— from Alhazen in present-day Iran, to Boethius and Dante in Italy, to Chaucer in England, and many more. While our main analytics in the course will be science and magic, this course will also offer questions of genre, philosophy and theology, text production, and language and translation. This course will require two writing assignments, as well as one discussion board post per unit.

In this course, we will encounter vindictive women, treacherous kings, heroes and anti-heroes, lawyers, berserkers, and poets.

# COURSE
MENAS 308 - Conflict and Comics: Reframing the Middle East
In recent decades, comics have evolved into a powerful medium for telling stories about conflicts in the Middle East, whether through autobiographical narratives or journalistic reports. The accessibility of comics as a kind of global language enables artists to convey the heavy toll that political strife, revolution, and war take on soldiers and civilians. This course considers the development of comics reportage and memoirs through the famous examples of Joe Sacco’s Palestine (1993-1995) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2000-2001). We then explore comics concerning civil and interstate wars in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, comparing works illustrated from the perspective of Western travelers with those written by natives to the Middle East or children of refugees. We also contrast printed formats with online comics, such as the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Welcome to the New World,” asking ourselves how digital platforms have reshaped comics and our reading experience.

# COURSE
MIDEAST 236 - Introduction to the New Testament
When and how did the first Christians began claiming that Jesus was God? Why were some of the early Christian writings excluded as "non-canonical"? Although it has influenced the Western world more than any other book, the New Testament — having originated almost 2,000 years ago in the eastern Mediterranean world — has much more to say than generally thought. This course will introduce the students to the vibrant historical, religious and social setting of nascent Christianity. The various writings must be allowed to speak for themselves and not to be clouded by later theological interpretations, or any artificial distinction between the canonical and the non-canonical. Students will be introduced to the insights and methods of modern scholarship when dealing with questions such as: What did these ancient documents really intend to say? How did they say it? When did they say it?

# COURSE

MIDEAST 322 - The Qur'an and Its Interpretations
Islam’s sacred scripture, the Qur’an, is the primary repository of the beliefs, values, ritual actions, and symbols of Islam. To a lesser or greater degree, it is present in the lives of over 1.6 billion people worldwide. For practicing Muslims, it is the primary guide in life and source of identity. It also effects the actions and mindset of less religiously committed individuals of Muslim background, not to mention converts to Islam. We will examine the history, structure, and contents of the Qur’an as a text/scripture and the major source of Muslim faith and practice, paying special attention to the manifold ways in which it has been received, understood, interpreted, and disputed by Muslims for over 1,400 years now. After familiarizing ourselves with the history of the Qur’an’s composition, literary features, and major themes, we will explore how it has shaped the lives and thought of Muslims since its inception until today. Among the themes discussed are the aural/musical, devotional, social, and material dimensions of the Qur’an, issues of its translation into other languages, and debates over its interpretation and the authority (credentials) necessary to interpret it.

# COURSE
MIDEAST 331 - Iranian Cinema: Re/Presenting a Nation

MIDEAST 480 - History, Memory, and Silence in the Middle East
This seminar takes an anthropological approach to studying the past, focusing on the politics of history-making, the role of memory, and the silences embedded in knowledge production about the past. We will explore how the past shapes the present, how the present reinterprets the past, and the complex relationship between history and memory. The readings address key questions: Is memory a depository of the past? Is history a record of it? Whose past is preserved in memory, and whose is silenced? Drawing from critical theoretical approaches, we will analyze how societies remember, commemorate, forget, and erase events. Memory becomes a contested site where anxieties about identity, authenticity, and colonial legacies are negotiated.

MUSICOL 407 - Special Course
This course examines a twenty-five-centuries-tradition of Chinese songs and their music histories in Chinese and global contexts. Allegedly,  Confucius (551-479 BCE) compiled the Shijing (The Classic of Poetry), an anthology of 305 folk, banquet and state sacrificial songs, and used it as a reference on civilized living and expressive communications. Since Confucius’s time, Chinese have been reading, chanting, and singing Shijingsongs (songs set to Shijing lyrics) with historically transmitted and/or newly composed tunes, demonstrating changes and continuities in Chinese music aesthetics, composition, performance, and reception. Chinese have also been telling evolving histories about the songs, justifying their diverse engagements with Shijing songs. To explicate the long phenomenon of Chinese singing Confucius’s songs, this course will survey literary-musical sources of the tradition, its evolving aesthetics, repertories, and composition and performance practices. And to discuss the phenomenon as a case study in Chinese and global music histories, this course will contrast historical narratives by Chinese and non-Chinese scholars.

PHIL 183 - Critical Reasoning
Reason better when deciding what to believe, and when deciding what to do. This course provides the tools you need, drawing from several areas: cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, logic, probability, and decision theory. We will consider empirical evidence about 'heuristics and biases’—spontaneous judgments that can be predictably irrational. And we will study what good deductive, causal, and probabilistic reasoning looks like. But the goal is entirely practical: to develop effective reasoning skills with clear applications in your personal and professional lives. Here are some questions we will examine:

# COURSE
PHIL 196 - First Year Seminar
We are all the beneficiaries of moral progress. Examples of moral progress in history include the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, and the civil rights movement. How does moral progress happen? This course will help us try to answer this question. Doing so will not only help us understand the past, but to understand how to move society forward now and in the future.

# COURSE
PHIL 215 - Practicing Ethics
Ethics is a branch of philosophy that tackles questions about how we should live – with a special emphasis on how we ought to treat each other. Undergraduate ethics courses have traditionally explored these questions by focusing on theoretical inquiry, for example on the nature of moral obligation and whether moral objectivity is possible, and whether there’s a universal answer to what moral rightness consists in. And questions in applied ethics have tended to focus on the most salient moral controversies and the most intractable disagreements. This course takes a different tack by asking a more practical question: if we sidestep these ongoing debates, what are the ways we can improve our day-to-day moral reasoning and try to become better people? How should we interact with people we disagree with? How can we improve our thinking about spending money, eating, building institutions, choosing careers? We’ll begin by diving into some evolutionary science to learn how humans evolved to be moral animals and how our moral reasoning works. We’ll consider whether and in what ways this evolutionary picture gives us reason to be skeptical about our current moral practices. Once we’ve gotten a general grasp of how moral reasoning works, we’ll zoom in to identify a whole host of cognitive glitches – ways in which our moral reasoning predictably goes astray. We’ll learn not only ways to improve our reasoning but how to cultivate entirely different mindsets, hopefully becoming slightly different people.

# COURSE
PHIL 250 - Changing the World
We tend to lead with our hearts when trying to do good. This means we focus on causes that are familiar and local, without thinking very hard about their relative moral importance, or how we could have the greatest possible impact. In this course, we will focus on truly global problems, thinking rigorously about their relative moral significance and how much we can reasonably do to solve them with our careers and resources.

# COURSE
PHIL 262 - Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of religion. In the portion of the class where we examine Judeo-Christian and Islamic intellectual traditions, we will discuss topics such as the viability of the ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments for the existence of God conceived as a supremely perfect being; whether a convincing argument for the existence of God is even necessary for theistic belief; the nature of the attributes of a supremely perfect being (such as eternity, omniscience, and omnipotence); and whether the presence of evil in the world is compatible with the existence of such a being. We will also study examples from the Vedic and Upanishadic literature, early Theravada Buddhist literature, and classical Chinese religious and philosophical literature. In this portion of the class, the topics we will discuss include the relationship between one's self and the world, motivation for moral behavior, and arguments for or against fatalism. A secondary goal of the course is to use this comparative approach to discuss how the definitions of the divine, "supernatural," or even immaterial are shaped by the intellectual milieu in which they are developed.

PHIL 289 - Descartes to Kant


# COURSE
PHIL 303 - Introduction to Symbolic Logic
Logic aims to clarify principles of good reasoning in a range of areas: ordinary day-to-day reasoning as well as more abstract investigations in mathematics and the physical sciences. A basic guiding idea is an idea that logically good reasoning is 'truth-preserving. ('Truth-preserving' reasoning cannot fail to take you from true premises to true conclusions. If the premises of truth-preserving reasoning are true, the conclusions must be as well.) So one goal we have in the study of logic is to get a grip on which forms of argument are truth-preserving and which are not. Another guiding idea is that the steps of a good argument should be “simple”, or “obvious”, or “clear”; so another goal will be to get an informative analysis of what it is for a step in an argument to be “simple”, or “obvious”, or “clear”.

# COURSE
PHIL 355 - Contemporary Moral Problems
We all want to live in a just society. But when we think about what a just society actually looks like, questions and controversies abound. Can we value free speech while deplatforming speakers with offensive views? In a just society which drugs should be legal? Should people be able to donate as much as they want to political campaigns? Does capitalism exploit workers, or is it the best economic system we can have?

# COURSE
PHIL 361 - Ethics
One of the most important questions one can ask is the central question of ethics: How should I live my life? Thinking about this question immediately leads to a whole host of other questions: Are there objective facts about how I should live? Or is ethics just a matter of opinion? And if there are objective truths in ethics, then what are they? What is a good life for a human being? How are we obligated to treat others? And what should we do when our good conflicts with the good of others? For instance, are we obligated to help those who are in poverty? And do we have any moral obligations to non-humans, such as animals?

# COURSE
PHIL 366 - Introduction to Political Philosophy
We all want to live in a just society, but what does a just society look like? Using a variety of theories (including utilitarianism, Robert Nozick’s libertarian theory, and John Rawls’s liberal egalitarian theory) as lenses, we’ll explore a number of questions for just public policy: What is the appropriate scope of legal regulation, and what justifies it? What constraints on individuals’ market transactions are morally permissible, and which are required? What is the justifying function of criminal law? Are there pre-conditions a state must fulfill to have the standing to punish violations of its laws? If so, what follows if the state doesn’t meet them? In each case, we’ll ask not only what would be just in an ideal society, but what justice demands under conditions like ours. Our goal is not just to discover how different philosophers have answered these questions, or what answers are available in theory, but to think about how we should answer them for ourselves, under our actual conditions. This means attending carefully not only to the points where varying theories disagree in principle, but also noting where they agree about what should be done next in real-world cases.

# COURSE
PHIL 424 - Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics
An introduction to the philosophy of quantum mechanics (QM), addressing two main issues. The first is quantum non-locality, which Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” The distant correlations QM predicts prompts questions about whether the theory admits or requires faster-than-light causal influences, and about whether the theory is consistent with the special theory of relativity. These very same correlations are integral to protocols for quantum cyptography, teleportation, and computation. The second issue is the quantum measurement problem, also known as the “Schrödinger cat paradox,” according to which a completely quantum world would be one in which experiments typically lack outcomes. A legion of interpretations of QM---including Bohmian hidden variable theories, many worlds interpretations, decoherence approaches, and stochastic reduction schemes---have been devised to address the measurement problem. We will study these and the frailties to which they are prone. While some background in physics or mathematics would be useful for this course, it is not essential: relevant formalisms will be introduced along with the philosophical questions they help to frame.

# COURSE
PHIL 443 - Foundations of Rational Choice Theory

While the main focus will be individual decisions, some aspects of game theory may be covered. Topics to be discussed include:

# COURSE
PHIL 475 - Topics in 20th Century Philosophy
This course explores the thought of some of the 20th century's most influential philosophers. Its focus varies according to the interests of the professor who teaches it. Some versions of the course focus on a single area of philosophy (e.g., philosophy of language or epistemology). Other versions focus on one or two thinkers (e.g., Wittgenstein and Russell). Still others compare the debates that were central in two different areas of philosophy, and/or relate these debates to developments in other fields. Students are expected to write papers on the issues raised in the course. Presentations and tests may also be required.

Next, we look at how the Enlightenment took hold in the colonies and the emergence of political debates on independence, rationality, liberty, equality, consent, and limited government. We pay particular attention to the liberal and republican traditions and how they shaped the constitution of 1787. We delve into a range of intellectual and popular movements such as the Great Awakening, the rise of print culture, and Transcendentalism. We look at movements that emerge among women, such as women ’s mobilization against slavery and women’s arguments for their own full political rights, including the right to vote. We will explore the impact of settler colonialism, the status of enslaved people, free blacks, and Native Americans, as well as the political and economic claims advanced by people of color. We wrap up with a look at the ideological, economic, and political conflicts that shaped the US Civil War.

This 4-credit course consists of three hours of lecture and one section meeting each week. The course will cover policy definitions/frameworks, the policymaking process, and how to evaluate and justify public policy through the lenses of science, ethics and social equity.  In addition, the course will include a number of short modules, this year focusing on key policy issues that are being discussed in the context of an election year, such as public policies regarding the environment/climate change, public health and health care, education, social welfare, immigration, international trade, and science/technology.  A number of guest faculty experts will assist with the short modules.

# COURSE
POLSCI 334 - Communism and Capitalism in Eastern Europe
The Cold War was said to be a battle between the forces of "Communism" and "Capitalism." But what do these ideologically-loaded categories look like in practice? This course explores state-socialist and democratic-capitalist economic, political and legal systems as they have played out in East Central Europe, focusing on people's daily lives, their material culture, their understanding of their rights as citizens, and their geopolitical position between East and West. The first half of the course will cover the "Communist" era, from the end of WWII to 1989. The second will cover the often-traumatic economic and political upheavals that have beset the region since their opening to global, capitalist markets, their fraught accession to the European Union, and their populist "innovations." Students will follow two countries from the region throughout the course. Feature films from East Central Europe will constitute part of the required assignments.

# COURSE
POLSCI 381 - Political Science Research Design
This course has two aims. One is to expose students to various approaches to conducting research in social science in general and political science in particular. The other is to provide students with a framework (both in terms of theorizing and in terms of writing) for identifying a problem to tackle in a thesis or another research project, placing the problem within the discipline, designing a methodology for investigating the problem, and proposing a tentative outline for an argument.

POLSCI 406 - Democratic Theory
The biggest problems facing earth dwellers today seem to exceed the problem-solving capacity of democratic political systems. The failure of wealthy industrial nations to rein in the acceleration of either wealth inequalities or climate change may provide evidence not just that our biggest problems are hard for democracies to solve but that democratic processes—mass voting, partisan representation, organized interests—may even intensify these problems and put the solutions farther and farther out of reach.

PORTUG 342 - Culture, Power, and Politics in Brazil
Soccer -known as fútbol in Spanish or futebol in Portuguese- is the most popular sport in the world. This survey course will use soccer as a lens to study the development of modern Latin American history, culture, and politics through its representations in literature, journalism, and film and television (the 1860s-2024). This is a class on the cultural, social, and political impact and uses of one sport in one of the most unequal regions of our modern-day world. This course will trace the trajectory of both the sport and the Latin American societies that received and molded soccer into the cultural force that it is today. Soccer has been used to fabricate national identities, promote multi-racial societies, and, of course, entertain the masses. We will explore these facets of its impact on twentieth-century Latin American history while acknowledging the more odious use of the sport in upholding dictatorships, drug trafficking, and misogyny.

# COURSE
PORTUG 461 - Brazilian Culture
Although most people in the United States have never heard of the Inter-American Commission or Court of Human Rights (IACHR), these institutions represent our hemisphere’s collective attempts to define and enforce basic standards of social justice for nearly a century. In Latin America, the IACHR became a touchstone for grass-roots groups and NGOs that struggled to build democratic societies in the final decades of the twentieth century, and then to pressure new democratic regimes to live up to their promise of social justice. Over the past decade, nationalist regimes of both left and right have rejected universal norms and international institutions and sidelined or even repudiated the IACHR. It is a critical moment to reflect on its history.This course will analyze the IACHR’s transformation since its inception in 1949 and to evaluate its impact. At the same time, the cases will illuminate the work of human rights movements in the hemisphere since the 1970s. Case studies chosen by students will address issues such as forced disappearance and torture; human trafficking and contemporary slavery; violence against women; reproductive rights; indigenous rights and racial discrimination; LGBT rights; and the rights of migrants and refugees. Assignments include weekly online responses to readings, two group presentations, a paper analyzing an IACHR case, and a final 5-page paper.

RCCWLIT 220 - Narration
What does it mean to make (up) a story? How do we discover the stories we have to tell, and how do we make them comprehensible and powerful for a reader? In this introductory seminar, we’ll study the choices writers make, invent and build our own stories, discuss each other’s work, and revise. We’ll also pay close attention to the work of a variety of modern masters of short fiction, to develop and deepen our understanding of the writerly toolkit. Some of our key artistic goals: achieving psychological realism, conveying emotion through detail and action, dramatizing rather than explaining, structuring meaningful story arcs, and building persuasive fictional worlds. Requirements include careful preparation, active participation, thoughtful drafting and revision of your own original stories, engagement in workshopping, and openness to critical feedback.

# COURSE
RCCWLIT 320 - Advanced Narration
The writer Katherine Anne Porter said, “Human life itself may be almost pure chaos, but the work of the artist—the only thing he’s good for—is to take these handfuls of confusion and disparate things, things that seem to be irreconcilable, and put them together in a frame to give them some kind of shape and meaning.” As a writer of short fiction, how do you craft your unique and original “frame”? How do professional writers learn to take risks in order to spot problems and possibilities in their work? How do writers portray Porter’s “confusion and disparate things” through a deliberate composition and revision process? In this fiction writing seminar, we’ll critique each other’s short stories in a class workshop devoted to the art and craft of the next draft. Class discussion and required written comments will explore fiction writing techniques to help shape what’s on the page while inviting the writer to bring more to their pages. We’ll also read short stories by a variety of contemporary authors doing what we all hope to do: write art. Open to students who have taken a previous fiction writing class.

# COURSE
RCHUMS 291 - The Experience of Arts and Ideas in the Nineteenth Century
The long nineteenth century was an exciting and unsettling time for society as well as for individuals. Social revolutions, such as those in 1789, 1830, and 1848, reflected cultural turmoil and new avenues of thought, while artistic changes revealed both the beauty and the harsh reality of the time. In Arts and Ideas of the 19th Century: The Arts and Social Change during the Century of Revolution, we examine the major movements in European art and cultural history of the nineteenth century, Romanticism and Realism. Among the works we consider are compositions by Beethoven, Berlioz, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Tchaikovsky, and Debussy; ballets of Perrot, Bournonville, and Petipa; spirituals of African Americans and pow wow music of Native Americans; writings by E.T.A. Hoffman, Emily Brontë, and Edith Wharton; and paintings by Delacroix, Courbet, Monet, Van Gogh, Morisot, and The Wanderers. Throughout the semester we analyze and compare these works and discuss how art reflected changes in the society that produced it; what were new attitudes of artists towards themselves, their art, and society; what was the intersection of imagination and reality with scientific, social, and political advances; and how the arts and literature represented and reflected the changes in women's roles and their place in society.

# COURSE
RCHUMS 306 - History of Writing in the West: The Book and the Body
Even though we’ve been told over and over that this is the age of information, and that what matters is the delivery of data, not the platform that presents it, written language is not just information flow; it is also matter—ink on paper, hands on keyboard, the ever-expanding server farms that root the “Cloud” very firmly to the land.

# COURSE
RCHUMS 312 - Central European Cinema
During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Central Europe were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in Central Europe were able to be more incisive, frank, and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers were able to take advantage of their regimes’ progressive official pronouncements with regard to ethnic and gender issues to craft powerful films which the regimes had no grounds to suppress. That legacy has carried on since the collapse of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, albeit uneasily, as new generations of filmmakers have delved into persistently troubling questions about the region’s past and present. In this course, we will examine the prewar roots of this tradition of critical filmmaking, its development through the Communist period, and how it has continued after the collapse of Communism. We will view and discuss fifteen films in chronological order (by production year) and consider their artistic structure—that is, how they go about transmitting their themes with power and emotion. We will use our developing sophistication in reading the films’ techniques to analyze what these films say about the intersecting themes of race, ethnicity, and gender during periods of social transition and crisis. This course fulfills the Race or Ethnicity (RE), Humanities Distribution (HU), World Literature (WorldLit), and Upper-Level Writing (ULWR) Requirements. There are no prerequisites. No knowledge of foreign languages is required. All readings and lectures will be conducted in English.

# COURSE
RCHUMS 333 - Art and Culture
How to succeed in social media without the internet? Before Tik Tok, Instagram, and even Myspace people have used the popular media at their disposal to connect with one another, cultivate their public identity, and find inspiration for how to dress, think, and behave. This seminar contends with the impact of a variety of media on the social nature of life. Not only will be a discussion of social media production, but it will also include various political and social moments of censorship. Objects central to discussion include portraiture, doll houses, album amicora (friendship albums), and graffiti. The media discussed in this class ranges from antiquity to the early twentieth century. Although the objects of discussion all predate the computer, class conversations will remain tethered to the contemporary digital phenomena that we now call “social media”. Through readings, class discussion, and ultimate preparation for a mock academic conference, we will unpack how media is intertwined in many aspects and dimensions of societal participation. Issues of identity, community, inclusion/exclusion, fitting in, performativity, and technological advancements- like the printing press- are central tenets of this course. The course is organized to develop skills related to an academic conference. Day 1 students will receive a Call For Papers (CFP), to which they must submit an abstract for a future presentation. Students will cultivate writing, presentation, and socialization skills related to an academic conference.

We will cover the names you know (Picasso, Matisse, O'Keefe, Pollock) as well as works that you might not be so sure about (drip paintings, urinals, a woman hanging from the ceiling by a rope), all while developing a series of questions about the nature of art and its relationship to the social and political context from which it emerged. Not only will this course provide an overview of the twentieth-century, Western art, it will equip you with the background necessary to begin to understand the art of the twenty-first.

RCIDIV 341 - Science and Technology in the Ancient Middle East
Pyramids and ploughs. Planetary motion and Pythagorean concepts. Thousands of years before the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment, the Arabic mathematicians and Hindi scholars, and the earliest records of Chinese astronomy or Greek philosophy, the people of the ancient Middle East and Egypt developed robust methodologies and tools for dealing with both cosmic curiosities and pragmatic need. Archaeological remains attest to the implementation of important agricultural and military advancements, such as aqueducts, the wheel, or siege machines. Ancient texts discuss creating glass, making beer (without hops), prescribing medicine, and predicting the movements of Jupiter using geometric algorithms.

RCIDIV 351 - Special Topics
Seventy-eight cards (26 more cards than today’s standard poker deck) broken down into 22 Major Arcana (or Trumps) and 56 Minor Arcana (14 in each of four suits, most often Cups, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles)—this is the standard deck of Tarot cards. But what exactly are these cards? One of the best definitions of the Tarot is a simple one: illustrations in a story without words. This definition may be all the more appropriate given the explosion in the number of new decks during the last thirty years. There is perhaps no other "story" that has been so lavishly and diversely illustrated. Along with historical decks (e.g., the fifteenth-century Visconti-Sforza Tarot; the eighteenth-century Ancient Minchiate Fiorentine Tarot; the Tarot of Marseilles; the early twentieth-century Rider-Waite Tarot, probably the most famous and widely-used deck), there are modern Tarot decks based on literary themes and authors (e.g., Greek myths, Norse myths, Arthurian legends, the Oz stories, Alice in Wonderland, Shakespeare, Dante, Tolkien), artists and art movements (e.g., William Blake, Bosch, Dali, da Vinci, Disney, Art Nouveau, Manga, Hello Kitty), fantasy creatures (e.g., mermaids, goblins, dragons, fairies, unicorns, vampires), and cultural/religious groups (e.g., Native Americans, African Americans, Gypsies, Mexicans, Buddhists, Chinese).

RCLANG 320 - Readings in French
Quebec has been singularly transformed since the end of the Second World War through the increasingly important arrival of refugees and immigrants. The various waves of immigration have resulted in numerous patent changes in the cultural and literary spheres. In this course, we will study the works of a few immigrant contemporary writers who publish in French in Canada, with a specific focus on Quebec and on works published in the 1980s and 1990s. Writers we will be interested in are, among others, of Italian, Chinese, Lebanese, and Haitian origin: their works offer various perspectives on the immigration experience, thematizing exile, migration, and both the meeting and clash of cultures. Furthermore, these works – mostly novels, but also a play and a volume of poetry – frequently include a sustained reflection on language, integrating at times several languages or a language that may be qualified as hybrid.

RCLANG 324 - Readings in Spanish
There is a consensus on the process of Globalization as the most important social, political, and economic event in current times. According to the most powerful organizations in the world, Globalization and Free Market are the best and only option for rich and poor countries to improve societies and solve several problems like poverty, social inequality, and environmental depletion to name some. Globalization and Free Market have been also promoted as the most effective tools to provide new forms of economic and social progress for minorities usually suffering from ostracism like indigenous communities. However, after 30 years of changes oriented by free market ideology, several political movements have emerged with a common goal: to diminish or change the effects of globalization in their societies. The present course centers on understanding the process of Globalization its benefits and downsides in Latin America with special focus on indigenous communities. Organizations from Chile, México and Colombia will be analyzed to understand the current situation and reactions to this economic model. Documentaries will complement readings and final evaluation will be based on student participation, three academic papers and class presentations.

RCSTP 220 - Political Economy
This course critically examines two key institutions of modern political economies: markets and capitalism. We ask what kinds of problems are inherent to each and what can be done to mitigate those problems. We look at four types of market failure: imperfect information, externalities, imperfect competition, and the undersupply of public goods. We look at two interrelated tendencies under capitalism -- growing income and wealth inequality and growing plutocratic power in the political sphere -- and three types of crisis to which these tendencies make contemporary capitalist political economies vulnerable: financial sector instability, deteriorating democratic legitimacy, and ecological ruin. Finally, we assess what policy responses to these crises offer the greatest promise of success, and which political strategies offer the best chance that these policies will be adopted.

RCSTP 251 - Belonging in College: Race, Class, Gender, and Higher Education
Who ‘belongs’ in college, and who feels like they belong? In this course, we examine the ways U.S. colleges and universities -- through their policies, programs, curricula, cultures, architecture, and more -- have included and excluded various groups of students along lines of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, and other systems of difference and power. Our interdisciplinary mix of course materials (e.g., sociological and psychological research, histories, memoirs, journalistic accounts, and more) focuses on the ways a broad range of minoritized students have navigated barriers to and within higher education and worked to create more inclusive and equitable institutions. Ultimately, this course aims to prepare students to critically reflect upon your own place in the world of higher education, navigate the all-too-common inequities of college life with self-awareness and intention, and participate in informed ways in helping cultivate educational environments that foster a sense of belonging for an ever-broader range of people.

RCSTP 489 - Organizing: People, Power, and Change
Do you want to learn how to make lasting changes on a larger scale than one person can normally achieve? Organizers do that by identifying, recruiting, and developing leadership; nurturing community around that leadership; and building power from the resources of that community. In this course, you learn how to do this kind of organizing. You form leadership teams of 3 to 5 classmates based on common values, identify the constituency with which your team will work, develop a campaign strategy to make a change that constituents think is important, try to implement that strategy. Organizing is a craft: you learn by doing and you get better with practice. You will learn five core leadership practices: building public relationships, turning values into motivation through public narrative, turning resources into power by strategizing, turning intentions into effective action, and structuring organization to develop leadership, engage constituents, and achieve goals. You will also learn to coach others and to receive coaching in organizing practices.

REEES 397 - Communism and Capitalism in Eastern Europe
The Cold War was said to be a battle between the forces of "Communism" and "Capitalism." But what do these ideologically-loaded categories look like in practice? This course explores state-socialist and democratic-capitalist economic, political and legal systems as they have played out in East Central Europe, focusing on people's daily lives, their material culture, their understanding of their rights as citizens, and their geopolitical position between East and West. The first half of the course will cover the "Communist" era, from the end of WWII to 1989. The second will cover the often-traumatic economic and political upheavals that have beset the region since their opening to global, capitalist markets, their fraught accession to the European Union, and their populist "innovations." Students will follow two countries from the region throughout the course. Feature films from East Central Europe will constitute part of the required assignments.

# COURSE
REEES 405 - Topics in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies
Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, traditional and social media has become a separate battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine war, which started in 2014, when the Russian Federation annexed Crimea and supported the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Russian government-controlled media flooded the public discourse with propagandistic messages and narratives that targeted both domestic and foreign audiences. The manipulations, fakes, rise of propaganda, and restriction of free media in Russia fuel its war in Ukraine. The course will give an overview of the main narratives of Russian disinformation and propaganda against Ukraine and the ways they are spread and discussed in press, e.g. a colonial narrative of “brotherly nations,” imperialistic narratives of a "Great Russia," the so-called “Russkiy Mir” (Russian World), and Russia's Great Victory in WWII. The course will also explore media literacy techniques and tools like fact-checking and information verification.

# COURSE
RELIGION 209 - Death, Immortality, and Afterlife
What defines our humanity? Is it our ability to use language, ponder abstract concepts, and create art, or is it our profound connection to the notions of death and immortality? Join us on a captivating journey through deep history, spanning from prehistory to the present, as we venture to answer these age-old questions. In this interdisciplinary course, we bridge the realms of history, cultural anthropology, archaeology, paleontology, developmental psychology, comparative religions, art, and literature to unravel the universal human quest for the meaning of life and death.

# COURSE
RELIGION 236 - Introduction to the New Testament
When and how did the first Christians begin claiming that Jesus was God? Why were some of the early Christian writings excluded as "non-canonical"? Although it has influenced the Western world more than any other book, the New Testament — having originated almost 2,000 years ago in the eastern Mediterranean world — has much more to say than generally thought. This course will introduce the students to the vibrant historical, religious, and social setting of nascent Christianity. The various writings must be allowed to speak for themselves and not be clouded by later theological interpretations or any artificial distinction between the canonical and the non-canonical. Students will be introduced to the insights and methods of modern scholarship when dealing with questions such as: What did these ancient documents really intend to say? How did they say it? When did they say it?

# COURSE
RELIGION 258 - The Bible as Literature
To study the Bible “as literature” means that we will approach these writings the same way we approach any work of literature: we explore characters, genre, narrative development, styles of narration, point of view, etc… Students will gain new tools for interpreting stories that may be very familiar, including the loss of Eden, the binding of Isaac, the Exodus from Egypt, and the battle of David and Goliath. We will also do close readings of passages from texts including Psalms, Proverbs, the Book of Job, and Ecclesiastes. We will consider some of the ways Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and secular readers have interpreted and made use of the Bible. In addition to analyzing texts in the Biblical canon we will explore some of the echoes of these texts in subsequent works of art, literature, film, and music.

# COURSE
RELIGION 277 - The Land of Israel/Palestine through the Ages
This course explores the region of the Middle East known as Israel by some and Palestine by others. It outlines the historical events that occurred in that territory from the earliest days of the past to the present, analyzes the various factors (political, economic, cultural, and religious) that shaped its development, and introduces empires and nations that ruled the land as well as the people who inhabited its cities and villages. The course will pay careful attention to matters related to issues of Race and Ethnicity; the volatile story of this land will here serve as a laboratory for examining the interrelation between race, ethnicity, and religion across three millennia.

# COURSE
RELIGION 326 - Jews in the Roman Mediterranean: Archaeology, Religion, and Culture
The history of the Jews in the Roman and Byzantine worlds is full of dramatic and world-changing events, from the destruction of the Jerusalem’s Second Temple in 70 CE (the focal point of Jewish identity and life for centuries) to the rise of Christianity (a sister religion turned combative opponent in the Roman world). At the same time, Jewish communities throughout the Mediterranean world flourished, living behind a rich cultural legacy which was both artistic and literary. This course will bring together the numerous resources historians have from this period – archaeological remains, epigraphy, papyrology, and art – as well as the multifaceted textual records, both Jewish and not, in order to introduce students to the exciting dynamics that defined Jewish history in this period. This course will use visual elements (slides, video clips from the Mediterranean region) and reading ancient texts in translation (all material will be provided in English).

# COURSE
RELIGION 342 - Jerusalem: One City Three Faiths
Jerusalem is a city holy to the three monotheistic communities who believe it to be sacred, albeit for different reasons. While in some ways the common sacrality invested in Jerusalem by the three major monotheistic religions brings them together—doctrinally and practically—historically speaking it has sparked tension and even violence in some cases. This course will explore the history of Jerusalem as a lens through which to reflect on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as the ways in which these three religions have interacted with one another from the Bronze Ages through the Middle Ages to the twenty first century. Our intellectual journey to Jerusalem begins before Jews had built a temple in the city and traces the Hellenic and Roman history of the city. Then we discuss the emergence of Christianity and the relationship of various Christian sects to Jerusalem, as well as the political status of the city during the late Roman and Byzantine periods. After that we address the rise of Islam and the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem with particular attention to the ways in which the city’s importance to Muslims refracts the broader relationship between Islam and both Judaism and Christianity. In tracing the history of the city up through the present day, we cover the Crusades, the Ottoman Empire, the emergence of Zionism, and the Israeli-Palestinian encounters. Throughout, we focus on questions of ritual, symbolism, messianism, the built environment, empire, law, and memory.

# COURSE
RELIGION 363 - The Qur'an and Its Interpretations
Islam’s sacred scripture, the Qur’an, is the primary repository of the beliefs, values, ritual actions, and symbols of Islam. To a lesser or greater degree, it is present in the lives of over 1.6 billion people worldwide. For practicing Muslims, it is the primary guide in life and source of identity. It also effects the actions and mindset of less religiously committed individuals of Muslim background, not to mention converts to Islam. We will examine the history, structure, and contents of the Qur’an as a text/scripture and the major source of Muslim faith and practice, paying special attention to the manifold ways in which it has been received, understood, interpreted, and disputed by Muslims for over 1,400 years now. After familiarizing ourselves with the history of the Qur’an’s composition, literary features, and major themes, we will explore how it has shaped the lives and thought of Muslims since its inception until today. Among the themes discussed are the aural/musical, devotional, social, and material dimensions of the Qur’an, issues of its translation into other languages, and debates over its interpretation and the authority (credentials) necessary to interpret it.

# COURSE
RELIGION 380 - Selected Topics
The biblical patriarchs have been held up as ideals of masculinity in Jewish and Christian communities for centuries. And yet, the biblical account of these men and their lives is sparse and cryptic. It will come as no surprise, therefore, those different religious communities have imagined the masculine strengths of these figures in very different ways. This course explores how different historical communities around the world have(re)constructed biblical masculinity and modeled their own gender ideals on these examples.

ROMLANG 400 - Topics in Romance Languages and Literature
Brazil shares its borders with ten countries and four official languages, making it one of the world’s longest geopolitical borders. Frontier spaces establish and limit national power and influence, constructing national identity in dialogue with questions of race, gender, sexuality, and class. What is the relationship between Brazil, its Spanish-speaking neighbors, and these frontiers, borders, and boundaries? How are gender and race constructed in spaces where the state’s presence is precarious or even absent? This course is primarily oriented toward the experiences, voices, and cultural production of Black subjects and communities in liminal geographies in South America; still, it dialogues prominently with Black frontiers throughout the Americas, in addition to interethnic relations between Indigenous, Asian, and Middle Eastern communities in frontier spaces, among others. We will use multi-media cultural products and theory to explore racialized and gendered frontiers, from the hinterlands of the Brazilian Northeast and rural banditry known as the cangaço, to the Pampas of the South and its mythical gaucho, and the experiences of  Lusophone migrants in North America. We will focus on themes of Panamericanism, Panafricanism, and decolonialism; masculinity, domination, and border violence; fugitivity, refusal, quilombismo, and marronage; sex work, homosocialization, and homoerotics; and landscape, labor, and property. Finally, we will examine how subjects in these spaces push back against the constructions that may dehumanize them, and they produce their own representations.

ROMLING 487 - Studies in Hispanic Linguistics
The concept of Mock Spanish (Hill, 1995a, 2008) refers to the introduction of Spanish-language material into English monolingual discourse with a hidden negative, primarily stereotypical, codification of Spanish speaking ethnic groups. “Moochas grassias, “Fleas Navidog,” “Vamanoos” and the ubiquitous “Hasta la vista, baby” are pervasive Mock Spanish expressions in US culture. In this course we will develop tools to describe and explain how these expressions constitute Mock Spanish, a type of covert racist discourse extensively used in Anglo-American society.

SI 422 - Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation
Any product—whether a website, a technological system, or an electronically mediated service—benefits from
evaluation before, during, and after the development cycle. Too often, the people who use a product cannot find
what they want or accomplish what they need to do. Products are more successful when they are developed through
a process that identifies how the products will be used, elicits input from potential users, and watches how the
products function in real time with real users. This course provides a hands-on introduction to methods used
throughout the entire evaluation process—from identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it,
engaging users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a product’s function through
usability testing and summative evaluation. Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis,
observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and task analysis. Students
will work on group projects that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.

# COURSE
SI 429 - Online Communities:  Analysis and Design of Online Interaction
This course is intended to help students understand and analyze communities that are formed in or maintained via online environments. Although there is a fair bit of disagreement about the definition of community (and therefore, online community), we will loosely use ‘community’ as a term to describe a group of people who engage in sustained interaction over time. The group may be held together by a common identity, a collective purpose, or merely by the individual utility gained from the interactions. We
will use the terms e-community and online community interchangeably, as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions. The course introduces students to important concepts, terms, and theories that will help them understand how online communities are used by millions of people every day for a variety of purposes. The course develops a language for discussing online communities critically, and applying those concepts to new designs. The major component of this class is a group project where students apply the readings, theories, and empirical findings from the class to critique an existing online community or design a new one.

# COURSE
SLAVIC 225 - Arts and Cultures of Central Europe
Central Europe belongs to those unique historical amalgams whose composition defies disciplinary boundaries. The course traces this region’s complex history, culture, and its current spirit. Central European literature, theater, film, and visual arts will be examined against the background of the tumultuous and often tragic events which left marks on the culture of Czechs, Germans and Jews during the 20th century. Symbiosis of these ethnic groups and their linguistic diversity will be discussed. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of Jewish culture in Central Europe. Jewish emancipation, disappearance of ghettos; antisemitism and the Holocaust are among the topics. Another topic is the resistance against the Communist order and its eventual disintegration in 1989 as documented by works inspired by the fall of the Berlin wall. Authors to be read include Prague’s Jewish legends, Hašek’s Good Soldier Švejk, Kafka’s Trial, K. Capek’s drama Rossum’s Universal Robots, Kundera’s Joke, J. Roth’s Bust of the Emperor; films include Wegener’s Golem, Hippler’s Eternal Jew, and Forman’s Firemen’s Ball.

# COURSE
SLAVIC 281 - Jews in the Modern World:  Texts, Images, Ideas
Using literature, film, visual arts, and other cultural documents, students will examine the multiple ways in which Jews in Europe, America, Israel, and the Middle East have responded to the cultural, political, economic, and social forces of modernity. By focusing on a variety of textual and visual material from the late 18th century to the present, students will have an opportunity to explore the processes by which Jewish culture has been shaped and re-shaped in the face of unprecedented new freedoms and persecutions. The development of Jewish life from the late 18th century to the present offers a microcosm for the study of race, ethnicity, and racism in the modern world and the course will illustrate how deeply embedded racial, ethnic, and religious discourses are in any discussion of Jews.

SLAVIC 470 - Topics in Cultural Studies of Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe
The events of World War II had a significant impact on the development of international law. In particular, in 1948, the UN adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Its author was the famous Polish-American lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who tried to study genocide as an urgent problem of the modern world and as a crime in the historical retrospective of human civilization. Lemkin's life and work were connected to Ukraine from his early professional development years. Coincidentally, in the following decades, the Ukrainian territory, as defined by Timothy Snyder, became part of the space of “bloody lands,” where many events have taken place over the past century that are now being discussed by historians, lawyers, and politicians in the context of mass violence and international crimes, including genocide.

SOC 100 - Introduction to Sociology
This course will introduce you to the field of sociology. You will learn what it means to think sociologically by answering the questions: What is society? How to better understand it? What is the role of individuals in society, and how society affects individuals? We will emphasize the importance of social institutions by developing the ability to go beyond our personal lives and connecting them to larger social processes and structures. The primary purpose of this course is to offer you an initial exposure to Sociology through the reading of empirical and theoretical books and articles.

# COURSE
SOC 105 - First Year Seminar in Sociology
This course peers into the lives of Americans through intensive analysis of their memoirs. Most people remember good and bad aspects of their lives well enough to share them with others in everyday conversation. But memoirs chronicle the most impactful experiences of our lives. Some of these authors expose their lives to strangers as a cautionary tale, others as a model for achieving economic mobility, still others to document life’s obstacles that they have managed to overcome. This course has three objectives: to apply theories about race, class, and gender to people’s “real life” experiences, to understand how people engage social identities in their interactions with others, and to deepen students’ understanding of inequality and its consequences.

# COURSE
SOC 122 - Intergroup Dialogues
In intergroup dialogue, students will participate in semi-structured face-to-face meetings across different social identity groups led by peer facilitators. Though topics will vary by semester, topics may include race, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, religion, and educational justice. Through readings, in-class exercises with thoughtful debriefs, and participant journals and other assignments, students will explore their own identities, build relationships across different identities and learn about pertinent issues facing various social identity groups on campus and in society. This course creates a setting in which students engage in open and constructive dialogue, learn about themselves and others, and explore issues concerning intergroup relations, conflict, and social justice. Ultimately, the goal of this class is for students to develop greater intergroup empathy, develop skills to collaborate across differences, and tools to participate in social change.

# COURSE
SOC 210 - Introduction to Statistics for Social Science
In this course, we will study the basic concepts and techniques of quantitative data analysis. Our primary focus will be upon understanding the application and interpretation of a variety of fundamental statistical techniques. This is an important element of quantitative reasoning which is an essential aspect of working with data and understanding many different types of research involving quantitative data. Even though there will be an emphasis on statistical techniques as they are used by social scientists, the course will provide the foundation needed for statistical analysis in many fields. By the end of the course, you will have learned the tools to be an informed consumer of social science quantitative research with the ability to evaluate many of the research claims made in academic work and public discourse.

# COURSE
SOC 255 - Sociology of Music: Impacts of Culture on Composition and Performance
The sociological perspective sees that every aspect of music is affected by social context and that music, in turn, has played a profound role in our societies and subcultures. This course examines the relationship of music and society, moving from micro to macro units of analysis: the individual in social context (composer, musician, audience member), the musical group, musical institutions, music in subcultures and societies, and global dimensions of music.

# COURSE
SOC 270 - Gender and the Law
This course explores contemporary legal responses to gender inequality in the U.S., with particular attention to the ways that feminists have tried to use law for social change. Topics may include sex and race discrimination on the job, pay equity, immigrant women’s labor conditions, regulations of pregnancy and abortion, domestic violence and incarceration, and the role of religious liberty in relation to LGBTQIA+ rights. We will study debates among feminists over these legal strategies, the interaction of law with society and culture, and the ways that the intersection of gender, racial, and ethnic identities make a difference in the application and effects of the law.

# COURSE
SOC 295 - Topics in Sociology
Drawing on readings mostly from sociology and political science, this course will discuss several urban policy areas and their relationship to inequality. Substantive topics include segregation, policing, education, immigration, crime, redevelopment, and more. Each topic will address inequality—how structure, culture, or some combination produces social inequality—as well as policy, moving beyond interpretation of the world to focus on actions to change it. Assignments will include several traditional elements—including reading responses, short essays, and a take-home midterm—as well as tasks designed to push students to apply lessons from class to real world policy situations.

# COURSE
SOC 305 - Introduction to Sociological Theory
This course introduces students to key texts of classical sociological theory. The goal in reading these works is to familiarize students with the core intuitions that underpin the discipline of sociology, as well as to sensitize students to the relevance of many of the ideas of classical sociological theorists for ongoing debates in the discipline and beyond. We frame our exploration of sociological theory by first reading exemplars of utilitarian/liberal political philosophy that early sociological thinkers reacted strongly against in constructing a new discipline. We then spend the bulk of the course reading classical sociological writings by Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and DuBois.

# COURSE
SOC 317 - Communism and Capitalism in Eastern Europe
The Cold War was said to be a battle between the forces of "Communism" and "Capitalism." But what do these ideologically-loaded categories look like in practice? This course explores state-socialist and democratic-capitalist economic, political and legal systems as they have played out in East Central Europe, focusing on people's daily lives, their material culture, their understanding of their rights as citizens, and their geopolitical position between East and West. The first half of the course will cover the "Communist" era, from the end of WWII to 1989. The second will cover the often-traumatic economic and political upheavals that have beset the region since their opening to global, capitalist markets, their fraught accession to the European Union, and their populist "innovations." Students will follow two countries from the region throughout the course. Feature films from East Central Europe will constitute part of the required assignments.

Students are engaged in a critical and contrasting assessment of community organizing and other social change methods.

# COURSE
SOC 331 - The Politics of Data
This course will concentrate on the importance of the Federal Statistical System for the governance of our country. The data from the Federal Statistical System is essential for our democracy as these data are the fuel for policy decisions by the federal government and state/local policymakers as well. The alternative is policy-by-anecdote. Unfortunately, there is an increased politicization of data – what should be collected, how a concept should be measured, who should be included in the data and who gets to see it. And even more critical is the outright refusal to fund, use or believe the evidence that comes from federal statistics.

# COURSE
SOC 368 - Criminology
This course provides an introduction to the sociological study of crime, criminality, and criminal victimization. The course begins with analysis of differing definitions of 'crime', the problematic nature of criminal statistics, media depictions of crime, and crime myths. We then review some of the major theoretical explanations of crime. The last section of the course explores specific types of crime, including violent interpersonal, conventional property, "public order", and white collar. The patterning of crime, criminality, and victimization by race, class, gender, and sexuality is attended to throughout the course.

# COURSE
SOC 445 - Diagnosis, Sex, and Society
Diagnoses are central to contemporary medical practice. They organize the everyday “doing” of medicine, guide prioritization and distribution of medical resources, structure access to medical care, shape medical research, & define the boundaries of normality. Receiving a diagnosis has far-reaching consequences -- for individuals, relationships, communities, and society. This centrality of diagnosis and diagnoses is relatively new, dating only to the mid to late 1800s. Even so, we tend to view medical categories as neutral scientific descriptions of “real” things that have their own existence. However, embedded as they are in the social world, diagnoses are also moral and political phenomena in their own right. Diagnoses are the products of specific socio-historical dynamics and multiple, sometimes contradictory, interests.

# COURSE
SOC 476 - Sociology of Bioethics
Bioethics is an enterprise in ascendance. In the early 1960s there were individuals concerned with moral questions occasioned by medicine and medical research, but they were not known as bioethicists. Nor did they have the institutional support of centers for bioethics, professional journals, government commissions, or graduate programs and professorships. Today bioethics is part of the landscape of the life sciences: ethics committees are mandatory in American hospitals; all federally-funded research that involves human beings or animals must be reviewed by a board constituted to protect the subjects of research; a plethora of seminars offer training in bioethics for those who need, or wish, to offer ethical advice; and bioethics courses are a regular part of the curriculum at universities, colleges and medical schools.

# COURSE
SOC 489 - Organizing: People, Power, and Change
Do you want to learn how to make lasting changes on a larger scale than one person can normally achieve? Organizers do that by identifying, recruiting, and developing leadership; nurturing community around that leadership; and building power from the resources of that community. In this course, you learn how to do this kind of organizing. You form leadership teams of 3 to 5 classmates based on common values, identify the constituency with which your team will work, develop a campaign strategy to make a change that constituents think is important, try to implement that strategy. Organizing is a craft: you learn by doing and you get better with practice. You will learn five core leadership practices: building public relationships, turning values into motivation through public narrative, turning resources into power by strategizing, turning intentions into effective action, and structuring organization to develop leadership, engage constituents, and achieve goals. You will also learn to coach others and to receive coaching in organizing practices.

# COURSE

# COURSE
SPANISH 295 - Introduction to Literature, Culture, and the Arts in the Hispanic World
Why are stories so important for us as humans? How are those stories or narratives created? How can we use them to understand the ways ideas of power, race, ethnicity, gender or class are formed? How can new narratives challenge or dismantle the ideas created by previous ones? The goal of Spanish 295 is to provide students with an understanding of how narratives work and with the tools to interrogate them critically in the context of the Hispanic world. By doing so, the course provides an introduction to the creativity of the Spanish speaking communities through the study of literature and films.

SPANISH 369 - Introduction to Film/Media Theory and Criticism
Through the discussion and analysis of feature-length and short films, this course will examine the history and conventions of realism as a genre in Latin American cinema. Approaching social realism, surrealism, and dirty realism as distinct and distinctly modern modes of cinematic expression, each of which aim to reveal, reflect, and/or represent lo real, we will discuss and analyze a corpus of films from Latin America that contain elements of each of these three subgenres, comparing and contrasting the conventions of each while discussing the significance of genre itself to filmmaking, reception, and analysis. Among the films we will consider will be Luís Buñuel's Los olvidados (1950) and El ángel exterminador (1962), Juan Ibañez's Los caifanes (1967), Bruno Stagnaro and Adrián Caetano's Pizza, birra, faso (1998), Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores perros (2000) and Bardo (2022), Lucrecia Martel's La ciénaga (2001), Alfonso Cuarón's Y tu mamá también (2001) and Roma (2018), Pablo Larraín's Post mortem (2010), Ema (2019), and El conde (2023), Amat Escalante's Heli (2013), Issa López's Vuelven (2018), and Elisa Miller's Temporada de huracanes (2023).

# COURSE
SPANISH 373 - Topics in Hispanic Studies
This course explores the intricate relationship between music and narrative in contemporary Hispanic literature, examining how various writers incorporate and transform musical genres like punk, salsa, tango, rock and roll, and jazz within their stories. These narratives use music as a space of congregation amid chaotic environments, addressing themes such as dictatorships, teenage alienation, urban violence, and machismo. Despite these challenging contexts, the literature celebrates music as a powerful form of rebellion and connection. Additionally, the course includes films and songs to provide a multifaceted understanding of music's role in shaping narratives and cultural identities across the Hispanic world.

# COURSE
SPANISH 381 - Survey of Latin American Literature, I
This course is an overview of Colonial Latin American literature. Because it is impossible to exhaustively cover the whole literary corpus of this historical period in an academic term, we will rather focus on the canonical texts that have been (and still are) fundamental for the understanding of the cultural development of the continent. We will read some texts produced by precolumbian cultures fist. We will later move to Columbus, Cortés and other early Conquistadors and discoverers that provides us with the first images of America. In this way, we will cover almost three centuries of literary textual production, until we reach the time when the Spanish colonies are preparing to fight for their independence. Students will see how closely related literary practice and socio-political and economic issues have been throughout the colonial period. The readings will be supplemented by the viewing of films that deal with some of the issues discussed in the texts.

# COURSE
SPANISH 423 - Visual Cultures in the Hispanic World
This course will trace the impact and influence of the modern muralist movement on visual culture in post-revolutionary Mexico. Through visual analysis and readings of historical, critical, and theoretical texts, we will consider the ways a generation of modern muralists (José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, and Rufino Tamayo) and photographers (Tina Modotti and Manuel Álvarez Bravo) forged new ways of seeing and thinking the meaning of concepts of history, identity, community, and belonging in the wake of the 1910 revolution in Mexico. Working across multiple disciplines of visual art, we will also consider the ways this generation's successors (artists such as José Chávez Morado, Remedios Varo, Leonora Carrington, and Frida Kahlo, among others) received, challenged, and reinterpreted the legacy of the muralists. Through these studies, we will develop our understanding of the history and significance of social realist, socialist realist, and surrealist movements in modern art. Students will make weekly contributions to a forum on Canvas, lead discussion 1-2 times during the semester, sit for in-class exams, and present a final portfolio/visual analysis of multiple works during the end-of-semester student colloquium.  Discussions in class will be supplemented by two site visits: one to the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) in Ann Arbor and another to the Detroit Institute of Art (DIA).

# COURSE
SPANISH 430 - Advanced Studies in Hispanic Culture and Society
This course surveys the history and culture of utopia and utopianism in the Hispanic world from the 16th to the 21st century. Departing from the classical model of utopia popularized by Thomas More’s "Utopia"—which envisions a positive but isolated somewhere-nowhere doomed to fail—students will explore other “faces” of utopia, including literary, cultural, and political aspects, learning how utopia has become a tool for cultural, political, and social change.

# COURSE
SPANISH 432 - Gender, Sexuality, and Culture
This course examines the cultural representation of gender and sexuality in the Spanish-speaking world analyzing a selection of recent Latin American and Spanish movies. Starting from the theory of “gaze” developed by Laura Mulvey in film studies, we will address questions related to identity construction, heteronormativity, queerness, feminism, patriarchy, and machismo. We will reflect on how different sociopolitical contexts contribute to the construction of femininity and masculinity in society and regulate sexuality. We will analyze the construction of the female character in movies such as, on the one hand, an “object of desire” and, on the other hand, a “monstrous feminine” (Barbara Creed). We will examine the social construction of masculinity between hegemonic and contra-hegemonic models and stereotypes considering famous movies such as “Plata Quemada” and “Fresa y Chocolate.” Finally, we will close the course with a section dedicated to the queer gaze and movies by Pedro Almodóvar, Anna Muylaert, and Sebastián Lelio. This section reflects the possibility of instituting a cinematographic gaze capable of constructing characters in movies in a non-binary way that supplants the rigid division between masculine and feminine in favor of greater fluidity between genders.

# COURSE
SPANISH 438 - Political and Economic Thought in Latin America/Spain
In recent years, the concept of racial capitalism gained currency as it has been taken up by scholars and activists as a valuable way to attend to the deep entanglement of capitalism and racism over the course of their modern history. Many critics have looked to and learned from the work of Cedric Robinson on this concept, and specifically his engagement with the Marxist, world-systems, and Black radical traditions. Others have engaged in debates about the significance of slavery in the history of the Americas and its connections to capitalism and racism. In this course, we will explore some of the scholarship on racial capitalism, focusing on important theoretical debates, and put it in conversation with primary sources on slavery from colonial Latin America. By reading these two bodies of texts together, students will learn how to deploy theoretical tools to read primary sources in new ways, and to draw from primary sources to shed new light on the interwoven histories of capitalism and racism in Latin America and beyond. Specific themes will include the history of slavery and the relation between slavery and capitalism; the rise and fall of Indigenous enslavement; the transatlantic slave trade and the racialization of Blackness; and resistance and the unfinished project of abolition.

# COURSE
SPANISH 443 - History and Historiography in Latin America/Spain
This course will analyze the relationship between literature and history in Latin America. We will read four examples of how literary fiction elaborates a counter-narrative to the official version of history, opening the debates related to memory, justice, human rights, and power. Contrary to the conventional opposition of literature as fiction to historiography as science, this course will consider literature’s ability to produce historical fictions that are complex and appealing to the public and able to problematize the limits of historiography and the very uses of history by the State. The main problem of such a class is to achieve an understanding of the notion of fiction different than something “false” or even “imaginary” (in the common sense). Fiction entails, on the contrary, a different relation to the real and to the historical truth, which implies a complex understanding of language’s function in the narrativization (and denarrativization) process. Historical fictions, therefore, are not imaginary tales, but a complex set of language’s elaborations of the historical processes that require special attention and critical skills.

# COURSE
SPANISH 445 - Romance Studies: Introduction to French-Spanish Literary Relations
This course familiarizes students with the complex and multifaceted tradition of Marxist theory and practice while also tracing Marxism’s role in some of today’s most vibrant political movements. Our comparative approach considers classical texts like The Communist Manifesto and State and Revolution alongside lesser known but no less important works by Latin American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals. Instead of working toward a single definition of Marxism, we explore the history of heterodox experimentation with the tradition’s most basic categories, always mindful of the continuities and discontinuities between different “Marxisms.” This necessarily interdisciplinary course incorporates readings and discussions that span philosophy, literature, history, and politics. Special focus is directed at Marxist analyses that attend to (and also sometimes fail to attend to) the interpenetration of class, race, and gender. Key figures for the course include: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, V.I. Lenin, Louis Althusser, Silvia Federici, Aimé Césaire, Suzanne Césaire, Frantz Fanon, José Carlos Mariátegui, Álvaro García Linera, Raquel Gutiérrez, and Subcomandante Marcos.

An important unit of the course is focused on reproductive health – looking at the biological processes of reproduction, but also the effects of racism, midwifery care, and the rise of medicalized birth. One social factor we explore is parental leave policies and how these intersect with real-life experiences of breast and chestfeeding (including pumping) and formula feeding.

How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism.

# COURSE
WGS 377 - Topics in Gender and Social Science
When is a person at rest being lazy, and when are they engaged in self-care or political resistance? How has the denial of rest to workers shaped the history of capitalism and white supremacy? How has enforced rest been used to contain some women’s creative and political power? How might your own exhaustion or need for more rest connect to broader histories of racism, sexism, ableism, and wealth inequality? In this seminar, we read a range of authors who address such questions about the politics and social history of rest in the U.S. Some key voices include Tricia Hersey (a.k.a. the Nap Bishop), Elliot Kukla, Audre Lorde, Jenny Odell, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman. We also consider the politics and economics of rest in relation to cultural and religious traditions such as sabbath-keeping that structure periodic breaks into communal calendars. Ultimately, our readings and discussions are designed to help us to understand some key ways that phenomena which might seem simply personal, physical, or ‘natural’ are shaped and given meaning by systems of social difference and power in which we are all embedded.

# COURSE
WGS 400 - Women's Reproductive Health

Most weeks, the course features guest lectures from faculty at the medical school and across campus, in order to provide depth and expertise, as well as interdisciplinary perspectives on reproductive health. There will also be connections with current events, with required viewing of a television series that engages with many of the course's themes.

# COURSE
WGS 411 - Rednecks, Queers, and Country Music
What does country music or the “redneck” have to do with the queer? What can the phrase “I’ll listen to anything but country” tell us about the connections among taste, identity, and social status? In the dominant U.S. middle-class culture, country music is linked to white, rural, working-class, heterosexual, southern, and Midwestern people and is invoked as a symbol of “redneck” bigotry. By contrast, queer identity is associated with multicultural, urban, coastal, and enlightened lifestyles. This seminar brings these clashing categories together to question popular images of each one. Is country and its constituency the face of American bigotry? Are queer and of color opposites to rural and working class? How did such notions originate? And are they useful, or counterproductive, for purposes of progressive social change?

# COURSE
WGS 422 - Feminist Political Theory
Should housework be waged, should sex be for sale, is the state intrinsically patriarchal? This class introduces students to some of the central debates in feminist political theory, which focuses on how gender matters to both everyday life and to larger, institutional systems and relations of power. During the first half of the course we will focus on key categories and analytic frameworks, e.g., public/private distinctions, gender, intersectionality, sexuality. In the second half of the term we will focus on specific topics common to political theoretical inquiry, e.g., citizenship, the state, violence.

# COURSE
WGS 433 - Advanced Topics in Gender, Race and Ethnicity in the U.S.
What is a border? A boundary separating those who belong from Others? A “contact zone” of cultural exchange? What is the history of the U.S.-Mexico border, and how does it shape the present? Efforts to understand this border frequently focus on expressive culture, especially music—Tejano, norteña, corrido. How might country music fit here? Though often associated with Anglo-white southerners, country music is core culture in the Southwest, and Latines are one of its fastest-growing constituencies. We will listen for the mexicanismo of country sounds, themes, and values to consider how this “quintessentially American” music anchors Mexican American identity in the borderlands. Framing country music as border culture, this seminar asks: How might border perspective change our understanding of country music, and vice versa?

# COURSE
WGS 450 - Transnational Feminisms
This course examines transnational feminism(s) as both an interdisciplinary field and a mode of movement-building. The course begins with exploring the historical roots of transnational feminism in global, women of color, Third World, and postcolonial feminisms. Students will learn about the feminist interventions of the mid-90s into women’s and gender studies to destabilize the debates and practices of universalism, representation, and knowledge production. The second part of the course explores how feminist scholars and activists around the world, particularly from the Global South, shape our understanding of contemporary issues in transnational feminism, both within and beyond borders. We will cover topics such as Islam, gender, and feminism; gender-based violence and activism; war, empire, and militarism; and migration and humanitarianism. The course will pay particular attention to the ongoing (and often unequal) exchanges between feminist, queer, anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, and other social justice struggles in different parts of the world. Students will emerge from this course with a strong foundation in transnational feminism as an interdisciplinary field and an understanding of how different feminist mobilizations across the globe are intimately interconnected.

# COURSE
WGS 482 - Special Topics Minicourse
This course takes up a single topic of a very specific or contemporary nature.

# COURSE
WRITING 160 - Multimodal Composition
This course is about speaking for yourself. Instead of traditional ethnography, where often an observer records cultural traditions and values from an outside point of view, autoethnography is all about hearing a voice from the inside. What happens when a person becomes the speaker, the artist, and tells their own story? What traditional molds and boundaries must the artist break with in order to insert their own narrative? Does the artist invent new ways of using language and storytelling to create a sense of self? And how might their art challenge the story of the world we were previously told? This course will explore questions like these by looking at how artists create identities across mediums, telling stories grounded in or inspired by personal and generational experience. This course takes an antiracist approach by examining the possibility of identity creation outside of dominant narratives, as well as by positioning our understanding within the systems of power artists are creating into.

# COURSE
