    "You're aspiring for a finance job in Chicago, and decide to put your new data wrangling skills to the test by pulling stock data from an API and calculating various statistics. The API we will work in this question is hosted by Financial Modeling Prep, and can be found at https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#daily-chart-charts. Specifically, we will use the \"**Daily Chart EOD**\" endpoint – search for it at the linked page.\n",

    "- Ticker: A short code that refers to a stock. For example, Apple's ticker is AAPL and Ford's ticker is F. \n",
    "- Open: The price of a stock at the beginning of a trading day.\n",
    "- Close: The price of a stock at the end of a trading day.\n",
    "- Volume: The total number of shares traded in a day.\n",
    "- Percent change: The difference in price with respect to the original price, as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make requests to the aforementioned API, you will need an API key. **In order to get one, you will need to make an account at the website.** Once you've signed up, you can use the API key that comes with the free plan. It has a limit of 250 requests per day, which should be more than enough. You will have to encode your API key in the URL that you make requests to; see a complete example of such a request at the [**documentation**](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#Stock-Historical-Price)."

In particular, [this page](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/playground?url=daily-chart-charts) will help you craft the URL you need to make a request to, though you'll need to make your account first.\n",
    "- To format the starting and ending dates you'll need to pass to the API, [`pd.date_range`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html) might be helpful, along with `pd.to_datetime`.\n",
    "- The [`requests.get`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) function returns a Response object, not the data itself. Use the `json` method on the Response object to extract the relevant JSON, as we did in [Lecture 8](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/lectures/lec08/lec08-filled.html#APIs-and-JSON) (you don't need to `import json` to do this).\n",
    "- You can instantiate a DataFrame using a sequence of dictionaries as input to `pd.DataFrame`. Once you've gotten your response object back, you're done 99% of the work involved with this question."

You will do this by – as usual – completing the implementation of a function. In Questions 3.1 through 3.9, your function will take in a string and return `True` if the string follows the pattern and `False` otherwise.\n",
