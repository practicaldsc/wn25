> Skills and tools for building practical data science projects, along with their theoretical underpinnings. `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `BeautifulSoup`, and Jupyter Notebooks, and also the math behind loss functions, gradient descent, linear and logistic regression, and other key ideas in machine learning.

This course will train students to use industry-standard tools to solve real-world problems, while giving them an understanding of how these tools work under the hood. After taking this course, students will be prepared to build data science portfolios, participate in research across campus, and succeed in data science internships. Refer to the [course homepage](../) for a more specific list of topics.

### Credit and Workload

This course is worth 4 credits, and counts for the following major requirements:
- Computer Science: Upper-Level CS (ULCS) Elective
- Data Science: Advanced Technical Elective or Application Elective
- Electrical Engineering: Flexible Technical Elective

Refer to the [Fall 2024 course evaluations](../assets/marketing/fa24-evals.pdf) to see what students from Fall 2024 said about the course. Student perceptions of workload from Fall 2024 are shown below; we expect this offering's workload to be similar.

<center><img src="../assets/marketing/workload.png" width=500></center>


### Prerequisites

The course is open to students from all majors.

The enforced prerequisites are discrete math (EECS 203), programming (EECS 280), calculus I, calculus II, and linear algebra. A probability and statistics course is an advisory prerequisite. Options include DATASCI 101, STATS 206, STATS 250, STATS 280, STATS 412, IOE 265, or ECON 451.

That said, we have allowed interested students to override into the course without meeting the prerequisites. In particular, many students are missing the linear algebra prerequisite. We will be providing linear algebra review materials as the semester progresses; students missing the prerequisite background are expected to self-study this material (and come to us for help!).

## Getting Started

The course website, [practicaldsc.org](../), will contain links to all
course content. There are also a few things you'll need to do to get set up.


### Computer and Network Recommendations

Make sure you have a laptop consistent with [CAEN recommendations](https://caen.engin.umich.edu/percomps/).

Test your internet connection with the [UM Custom Speedtest website](http://umich.speedtestcustom.com/) and make sure it meets the [minimum requirements for any UM service](https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/76/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=5091). You'll need more bandwidth if there will be multiple simultaneous users in your household.

Resources for help with computing equipment:
- Information and Technology Services (ITS) [Laptop loaner program](https://its.umich.edu/computing/computers-software/sites-at-home)
College of Engineering (CoE) [Office of Student Affairs](https://studentaffairs.engin.umich.edu/), email requests to coe-studentaffairs@umich.edu

You may also use computer workstations in CAEN labs on campus or [connect remotely](https://caen.engin.umich.edu/connect/).

### Websites

You'll need to make accounts on the following sites:

- **Ed:** We‚Äôll be using Ed as our course message and discussion board. (Think of Ed as a replacement to Piazza.) More
  details are in the [Communication](#communication) section below. If you
  didn‚Äôt already get an invitation to our Ed course, [sign up
  here](https://edstem.org/us/join/PeKj7Q).

- **Gradescope:** You‚Äôll submit all assignments to
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/930446). This is where all of
  your grades will live as well. Most of the assignments will be coding
  assignments. Parts of these assignments will be manually graded, but most of
  them will be autograded. You should have received an email invitation for
  Gradescope, but if not please let us know as soon as possible (preferably via
  Ed). Note that we will **not** be using the EECS-specific "Autograder" platform.

- **GitHub:** You will access all course content (lecture slides and assignments) by _pulling_ our course GitHub repository. That repo
  is here:
  [github.com/practicaldsc/wn25](https://github.com/practicaldsc/wn25). Don't worry if you've never used Git before ‚Äì the [‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup](../env-setup) page will walk you through all of the necessary steps.

{: .red }
Note that we will **not** be using Canvas for anything this semester (so please don't try and send us messages on Canvas!).

### Development Environment

As soon as you are able to, go follow the steps in the [‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup](../env-setup) page of the course website to set up your programming
environment for the course. Discussion 1, **held on Thursday, January 9th**, will be dedicated to making sure you've followed these steps.

### Forms

Please fill out the required [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwn5kPDKgrHlyypVlp0hl2WyTVifBnQ1OO_g9U56FlrFE6aQ/viewform) to tell us a bit more about your background and whether you need an alternate exam **no later than Wednesday, January 15th**.

---

## Communication

This semester, we‚Äôll be using Ed as our course message board. You will be added
to Ed automatically; use the invite link in the section above if you weren't
added.

If you have a question about anything to do with the course ‚Äî if you‚Äôre stuck
on a problem, didn‚Äôt understand something from lecture, want clarification on
course logistics, or just have a general question about data science ‚Äî you can
make a post on Ed. We only ask that if your question includes some or all of an
answer (even if you‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôs right), please make your post private so
that others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously to other students if
you prefer.

Course staff will regularly check Ed and try to answer any questions that you
have. You‚Äôre also encouraged to answer questions asked by other students.
Explaining something is a great way to solidify your understanding of it!

**Please don‚Äôt email individual staff members, just make a private or public Ed
post instead.**

---

## Course Components

### Lectures

Lectures will be held in-person on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3-4:30PM in 1670 BBB. Attendance is not required, **though you are encouraged to attend in-person if you are able to**, no matter which section you're enrolled in (i.e. students in LEC 002 and LEC 003 can both attend lecture). Lectures will be recorded.

Recordings will be made publicly available so that students who are not enrolled ‚Äì including students not at Michigan ‚Äì can benefit from the recordings. As part of your participation in this course, you may be recorded (e.g. if you answer a question). If you do not wish to be recorded, please email Suraj to discuss alternate arrangements.

<!-- Note that more students are enrolled in the course than the lecture room can fit, but usually, enough students consume material remotely that we don't anticipate in-person space to be a bottleneck for anyone wishing to attend the class in-person. Still, you may be unable to find a seat in the first few lectures. -->

Lecture slides/notebooks will be your main resource in this class. You can access
them, along with all course materials, by pulling from the course GitHub
repository, [github.com/practicaldsc/wn25](https://github.com/practicaldsc/wn25); instructions on how to do this are in the [‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup](../env-setup) page. We will also link HTML previews of each lecture notebook from the course
homepage; you can use these to annotate the lecture notebooks with a tablet, if
you'd like.

For some topics, we will prepare official "Guides" that you're also expected to read and reference while working on assignments.

Supplementary readings will be made available on the course homepage, drawn from a variety of online resources. Additional supplementary resources can be found in the [Readings](../resources#readings) section of the Resources tab of the course website.

### Discussions

There are four discussion sections on Thursdays. Their times and locations can be found on the [Calendar](../calendar) tab of the course website. **You can attend any discussion session, but if space fills up, priority will be given to students officially enrolled in that section.**

The first discussion, held in the first week of class, includes some useful instruction and tips for using Jupyter Notebooks, the programming environment we‚Äôll be using in this course. It should be helpful to get you set up and comfortable with the technology you‚Äôll be using all semester.

Subsequent discussion sections will be focused on exam preparation. Students will work through problems from past exams in related courses and be able to get help from course staff. Attending discussion and working through practice problems gives you direct experience with the types of theoretical questions you will see on exams. **Discussion sections will not be recorded**. The purpose of discussion is to give you hands-on problem-solving experience, so you really need to attend and participate to reap the benefits.

In order to incentivize you to attend discussion, **discussion attendance can _optionally_ count towards your course grade**. There will be 13 discussion sections total, and we will take attendance in each one. Each week you attend discussion will earn you 1 "discussion point", up to a maximum of 10 discussion points. Your discussion score will be the number of discussion points you earn out of 10. This means that you can miss up to 3 discussions for any reason (late add, extenuating circumstances, etc.) and still earn a full discussion score. Details can be found in the [Grades](#grades) section below.

### Homeworks

There will be **11 homework assignments** due throughout the semester, usually on Tuesdays (except for Homework 1). Expect each homework assignment to take ~8-10 hours to complete. Even though this is a programming-heavy class, expect it to have the workload patterns of a more theoretical class ‚Äì that is, expect a constant, moderate level of work each week, rather than having some weeks with very little work and some extremely heavy weeks.

Homeworks will be distributed in Jupyter Notebooks, in which you will write Python code. For programming problems, public tests will be provided to make sure you're on the right track, however, your submission will be graded using an autograder with hidden tests. Many homeworks will also include written questions which must be answered on pen-and-paper; these allow us to assess your understanding of more theoretical ideas underpinning core data science techniques taught in lecture. Autograded questions and written questions must be submitted to two separate Gradescope assignments but count as one big assignment for the purposes of grading. The [Example Homework](https://github.com/practicaldsc/wn25/blob/main/homeworks/example-hw/example-hw.ipynb) shows the typical format of a homework assignment and explains the submission workflow.

Each homework is worth the same amount, but the **lowest two homeworks will be dropped** when
calculating your final score. Homeworks will be released at least a week before the due date. You will access homeworks by pulling the course GitHub repository, and will submit your completed homework as Jupyter Notebooks to Gradescope (we will not be using the EECS autograder). You may turn them in as many times as you like before
the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it‚Äôs a
good idea to **submit early and often**. For homeworks with both an autograded and written submission, your submission time will be the **latter** of the two submission times.

Note that **all homeworks are to be completed individually**. See the [Collaboration and Academic Integrity](#collaboration-and-academic-integrity) section for more details. That said, you're
encouraged to discuss all assignments with others at a conceptual level in
office hours and study groups.

### Final Project

In the Final Project, you'll work on an open-ended investigation of a dataset of your choosing from a fixed set of options, using the tools from throughout the semester. Your work will culminate in a public-facing _website_ that you can share with friends, family, and on your resume. Visit the [Showcase](https://practicaldsc.org/showcase) to see Final Project submissions from prior semesters. (Previously, the assignment was called the "Portfolio Homework"; it has not changed in spirit, despite the new name.)

We will release the spec for the Final Project before the Midterm Exam, and it will not be due until the last week of classes, so you'll have over a month to complete it. For now, note that the Final Project is different than homeworks in the following ways:
- You can work with one partner, but aren't required to.
- You cannot use [slip days](#late-policy-slip-days-and-drops) on the Final Project, since it's due at the end of the semester and we need time to grade it.
- The Final Project is not be autograded at all; it will be fully manually graded.

### Office Hours

To get help on assignments and concepts, course staff will be hosting several
office hours per week. The vast majority of office hours will be held in-person on North Campus, though we will hold a few Central Campus and remote office hours, depending on staff availability. See the [Calendar](../calendar) tab of the course website for the most up-to-date schedule and directions.

{: .yellow }
**We use the term "office hours" but really, office hours are held in a common room where you can come to work on assignments, meet your classmates, and get help from course staff. We don‚Äôt bite and we would love to see you in office hours!**

Office hours are your chance to ask for general help, clarification on homeworks, and to review previous homeworks. Course staff will not tell you if your answer is correct, and it is inappropriate to ask. Here are some really good questions to ask instead:
- I got confused about a concept in class. Can you explain it?
- When the assignment says X, does it mean A or B?
- My code is giving a weird error - can you help me understand why?
- I can‚Äôt get this test to pass, so I must be doing something wrong. Can you help me figure it out?
- My code is doing something different than what I expected. Can you explain what is happening?

Questions that you should never ask us:
- Is this the right answer?
- Can you check my code and make sure it is right?
- What is the answer?
- What‚Äôs going to be on the exam?

Your primary motivation when interacting with course staff should be **learning**.

### Weekly Schedule

To summarize all of the events and deadlines, refer to this general weekly
schedule (which is subject to change in any given week):

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday     |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
|  Lecture    |  |   Lecture        | Discussion  |   |
| | <span style='color:red'><b>Homework N - 1<br>due 11:59PM</b></span> | <span style='color:red'><b>Homework N<br>released</b></span> | | |

## Exams

This class has one Midterm Exam and one Final Exam. The Final Exam is **not** cumulative, in that the focus will be on content from the second half of the semester, though the content in the second half of the course builds on the first half. The exams will feature a mix of multiple choice, select all, short answer, and long answer questions, including questions that require you to write code and do math. See [study.practicaldsc.org](https://study.practicaldsc.org) for links to the exams from previous offerings.

- **Midterm Exam**: Tuesday, February 25th, 7-9PM

- **Final Exam:** Monday, April 28th, 10:30AM-12:30PM

**Both exams will be administered in-person and on paper**. If you have conflicts with
either of the exams, please let us know on the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwn5kPDKgrHlyypVlp0hl2WyTVifBnQ1OO_g9U56FlrFE6aQ/viewform). We may provide alternate exam times for students with a valid, documented conflict with a required activity in another course or official university-affiliated activity, or to help students avoid negative academic consequences when their religious obligations conflict with academic requirements.

## Grades

### Assignment Weights

The **default** grading scheme is shown below:

| Component                               | Weight              | Notes                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Homeworks                                    | 42% | ‚Ä¢ 11 total; 2 lowest scores dropped <br> ‚Ä¢ 8 [slip days](#late-policy-slip-days-and-drops) available to use with a max of 2 per homework  |
| Final Project | 8% | no slip days allowed |
| Midterm Exam                            | 25%                 |  |
| Final Exam                              | 25%                 |  |

We will compute your grade as follows:

$$\boxed{\max(\text{default}, 97\% \cdot \text{default} + 3\% \cdot \text{discussion points out of 10})}$$

This effectively makes discussion attendance optional, since you can still earn 100% of the available points without ever attending discussion. See the [Discussions](#discussions) section above for details on how discussion scoring works. 


### Letter Grades

Grading for this class is not curved in the sense that the average is set at
(say) a B+ and half of the class must receive a grade lower than that. If
everyone does well and shows mastery of the material, everyone can receive an A
(this would be awesome!). If no one does well (this is unlikely), then everyone
can receive a C.

Grading for this class is curved in the sense that we do not have a pre-defined
mapping from project and exam scores to a final GPA. There is no pre-determined
score (e.g., 90% of all possible points) that earns an A or a B or a C or any
other grade. To determine the final grade, we will ask questions like ‚ÄúDid this
student master the material?‚Äù. With that said, grades will not be any stricter
than the standard grading scale (where an A+ is a 97+, A is 93+, A- is 90+,
etc). For instance, the threshold for an ‚ÄúA‚Äù will never be higher than 93%.

The distribution of letter grades in Fall 2024 is shown below. Our distribution will likely be similar, though not identical. (The majority of "E" grades came from students who did not participate in the course.)

<center><img src="../assets/marketing/fa24-letter-grades.png" width=500></center>

Try your best not to worry about grades, and we‚Äôll reciprocate by being fair.
We‚Äôre in this together ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### Late Policy, Slip Days, and Drops

All homeworks must be submitted by 11:59PM Ann Arbor time on the due date to
be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before
the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it‚Äôs a
good habit to submit early and often. If you make a submission after the
deadline, your assignment will be counted as late.

You have **8 "slip days"** to use throughout the semester. A slip day extends
the deadline of a homework by 24 hours. **You may use up to 2 slip days on any one homework assignment. You cannot use slip days on the Final Project.** Note that you do **not** use up any slip days on homeworks you don't submit, e.g. if you choose not to submit Homework 2, it costs you 0 slip days.

Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency
in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete a homework on its original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slip days are also meant for things like the internet going down at 11:58PM just as you
go to submit your homework. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional
circumstances, so you probably should not need to use all 8, but if you have
something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your
classwork on time, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can work
something out. The earlier you let us know that something's going on,
the more we can do to help, so please reach out.

Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the semester, and you don‚Äôt
need to ask in order to use one. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep track of
how many you have left. If you‚Äôve run out of slip days and submit an assignment
late, that homework may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when
we calculate grades at the end of the semester.

### Regrade Requests

For most homeworks, we will accept regraded requests. If you feel that there in an error in the autograder or that the manual
grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request within one week of the grades being released. If you do not submit a regrade request within one week, your original grade will be final.

**Regrade Requests for Manually Graded Problems**

To submit a regrade request for a manually graded problem, make the regrade
request directly on Gradescope. Note that part of your grade is clarity, so if
your answer was mostly right but unclear you may still not be eligible for full
credit.

**Regrade Requests for Autograded Problems**

To submit an autograder regrade request, please fill out the [Autograder
Regrade Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6Z7g3eDvZh4WuakJUqmWFiui41qqaK63_g5ZVtyK4iFmHfg/viewform).

Note that it's rare that something is wrong with the autograder, and if that's the case, we'll typically fix the necessary test cases and re-run the autograder for the entire class.

## Collaboration and Academic Integrity

This will be a tough, but rewarding course. While you will be
challenged this semester, we will be offering you plenty of support through
office hours and Ed. Make good use of these resources, and you will be able to
succeed in this course.

In this course, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and course staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete your assignments. However, **all work you submit must be your own, original work**; collaboration must not result in solutions that are identifiably similar to other solutions, past or present.

</table>

If you are unsure about what constitutes an honor code violation, please contact the course staff with questions. The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgement. Here are some suggestions for completing your work:

- Don't look at or discuss the details of another student's code for a homework you are working on, and don't let another student look at your
  code.
- Don't start with someone else's code and make changes to it, or in any way
  share code with other students.
- If you are talking to another student about a homework, don't take notes,
  and wait an hour afterward before you write any code.

### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence

Our course policy on the use of GenAI tools for homeworks is simple: **you _can_ use these tools to build an understanding of course material and to assist you on assignments, keeping in mind that no tool is a substitute for a strong understanding of course concepts.**

Some examples of responsible use of generative AI include autocompleting repetitive/boilerplate code and suggesting edge cases. Creating large sections of code you do not understand yourself is using generative AI in an irresponsible way, **and is likely to be detrimental when it comes to showing what you know on exams, which are worth 50% of your course grade and do not allow generative AI tools.**

### Honor Code

We report suspected violations to the Engineering Honor Council. To identify violations, we use both manual inspection and automated software to compare present solutions with each other, with past solutions, and with code found online. The Honor Council determines whether a violation of academic standards has occurred, as well as any sanctions. Read the [Honor Code](https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/honor-council/) for detailed definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic misconduct.

## Student Support and Well-Being

### Accommodations

If you need, or think you might need, an accommodation for a disability, please let us know during the first three weeks of the semester. Some aspects of this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the [Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)](http://ssd.umich.edu) office to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD ([ssd.umich.edu](https://ssd.umich.edu); 734-763-3000) recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will be treated as such.

### Diversity and Inclusion

It is our intention that students from all backgrounds and perspectives will be well served by this
course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class will be viewed as an asset. We
welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender
expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, socioeconomic background,
family education level, ability - and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this
class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every
other member of the class. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.

### Campus Resources

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can negatively impact your learning, such as
anxiety, depression, interpersonal or sexual violence, difficulty eating or sleeping, loss/grief, and/or
alcohol/drug problems. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished
academic performance and affect your ability to participate in day-to-day activities.

In order to support you during such challenging times, the University of Michigan provides a number of
confidential resources to all enrolled students, many of which are listed [here](https://wellbeing.umich.edu/tools-resources/#resourcesforstudents). Some particularly useful resources include:

- [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://caps.umich.edu/contact); 734-764-8312 (24/7 line)
- [Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC)](https://sapac.umich.edu); 734-936-3333 (24/7 line)
