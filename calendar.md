# ðŸ“† Calendar


The times and locations of office hours, as well as lectures and discussions, are all in the calendar below. The times and locations of office hours are subject to change week-to-week, so make sure to check the calendar before attending.

**If attending in-person office hours**, put your name on the [Office Hours Queue](https://eecsoh.eecs.umich.edu/queues/2lbxJSrtWrZBa1wAlRt1mI4E3ha) so that we know who we're looking for!

<div align="center" markdown="1">

[Access the office hours queue for in-person office hours here.](https://eecsoh.eecs.umich.edu/queues/2lbxJSrtWrZBa1wAlRt1mI4E3ha){: .btn .btn-purple }

</div>

The events are color-coded:
- Lectures and discussions appear in <span style="color:#668cd9"><b>blue</b></span>. These are all held on North Campus.
- In-person office hours held on North Campus appear in <span style="color:#e0c23f"><b>gold</b></span>. These are typically held either in the BBB Atrium or a BBB conference room, though occasionally in other North Campus areas.
- In-person office hours held on Central Campus appear in <span style="color:#3b995b"><b>green</b></span>. These are held in the Shapiro Undergraduate Library, i.e. the "UgLi", in the back of the basement where the desktop computers are.
- Remote office hours appear in <span style="color:#e6804d"><b>orange</b></span>, and can be accessed at [**this Zoom link**](https://umich.zoom.us/j/95923283134). Very few of our office hours are being held remotely, so if youâ€™re able to, youâ€™re strongly encouraged to attend in-person. **For remote office hours, don't join the office hours queue, just join the Zoom link.**
